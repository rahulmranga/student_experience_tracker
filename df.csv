I demanded that they give me the difference in lease rates between them and the new place I had to sign at, $2880, and after a ton of back and forth, they demanded that I take down the website, withdraw all my reviews and complaints as resolved, and never speak about it again before they'll give me that. I told them I would do that after they offered compensation to everyone they did this to, and they refused. They tricked a bunch of people into signing forms saying it was a mutual termination.

At this point in the leasing season, all the good places are full, and the remaining places have jacked up rates. They do this every year to tons of people. I made a website that details everything, https://austinuniversityhouse.com.

I demanded that they give me the difference in lease rates between them and the new place I had to sign at, $2880, and after a ton of back and forth, they demanded that I take down the website, withdraw all my reviews and complaints as resolved, and never speak about it again before they'll give me that. I told them I would do that after they offered compensation to everyone they did this to, and they refused. They tricked a bunch of people into signing forms saying it was a mutual termination. So unfair that they're taking advantage of students who don't know much about the leasing process this way. They just want to shut up the squeaky wheel.","[0.53074896, 0.45820364]",0.53074896,0.45820364356040955,0.0,0.0,-0.06980833333333332,college_peers

TA doesn't know what to do because the professor has the tests. Nobody is able to contact the professor.

What happens in this scenario? Could we possibly be required to retake the test at a later time? This was my last exam and I was planning on leaving after.

EDIT: Had my phone off, sorry to keep y'all waiting lol.

About 80 mins of waiting around, the professor was finally contacted. She sent a digital copy of the test to the TA to show/print and said she was on her way. The TA was going to present the test on the projector and then we work out the problems on scratch paper. Then a student interjected that it was university policy to not take the final until the professor showed up. The TA agreed so we waited around for the professor showed up.

In the meantime, a student had contacted the Dean's office and had confirmed that we don't need to stay there. After 2 hours without the professor showing up, a university representative came and had us write down our names and said don't worry about the test and leave. They said if we had to leave Austin that would be fine. Also told the seniors not to worry about graduation. I'm guessing this means we won't have to take the exam? I will update this post once I hear more.

Apparently, the professor was an hour late to the final for the other class earlier this week. Not a good look.

EDIT 2: I just got an email asking for my schedule (other exams, travel, etc). The professor said this was in case we needed to reschedule the exam. I really hope this won't be the case lol. I wish we could have the option to just take our current grade in the class.

Edit 3: Another email. No surprise that everyone's schedules were different. The professor seems very remorseful for what has happened. She said the department presented options of:

1. Video ourselves taking the final and send it back electronically.

2. Take our current grade in the class.

3. Other suggestions.

It is not clear whether we will individually choose our option or a majority option gets chosen for the whole class. Hoping it is the former.

Edit 4: This will probably be my last update for a while. Looks like we can individually choose an option, not just a ""one fits all"" type of thing!

I hadn't intended my original tweet to get nearly half as much attention as it did, when I asked if anyone wanted to join it was half me making a joke, half me actually asking. When everyone started asking to join I capped how many people I was going to add to a server to about ten. Im fairly new to Minecraft, so I didn't know how to add anyone to my server at first (process is actually more complicated than I thought), or whether there was a limit to how many people I could add (is there a limit?). A friend and I are currently in the process of getting the Minecraft UT server started, and we'll add as many people as possible. 

I've only been able to complete the outside of Parlin Hall, half of the outside of Calhoun Hall, the courtyard in front of the tower, and a little bit of Littlefield Fountain (not pictured cause it's looking rough so far, she's a work in progress.) It's taken me about four months, this is more of a side project that I like to work on when I have time on my hands. The trees have been a deterrent honestly it's so annoying to make them.

The repica is not perfect, I don't think it's to scale and I'd like to work on that. If anyone has any tips on how to make this whole process easier, any apps I could download that would help the building/add more items I can use to make it look more realistic, or if they wanna go ahead and add some floor plans for the buildings so I can get started on the inside of Parlin Hall/Calhoun Hall that would be awesome!

Dear Friends, 

We are deeply saddened to announce, despite every effort to make it work, that we will have to close our doors permanently. 

It is impossible to fully express our gratitude to all of you who have supported us over the years. Some of you have been with us since the early days on Speedway.  We have met so many of you in West Campus. We have loved getting to know you, your families, friends and co-workers.  We have witnessed the weddings of our customers and our staff, watched your children grow up…  We have watched you graduate, move all over the country, find love and success in your lives....  And so many of you have come back to say hello and let us know how you are doing. Our staff feels like family. We can’t emphasize that enough.  Working with such incredible people made every day incredibly fun!  That’s what has made it so rewarding, but so hard to say goodbye. We will truly miss you all.  

We are sad for all those who have been affected by the pandemic, especially those who have lost loved ones. We also know that many of you have been affected economically by this crisis. We wish you the best. Please stay in touch. We want to see how you are and know you are ok. We will keep you abreast of what new adventures surely await each of us. Send pictures, it’s going to be hard to not see your faces every week, some of you every day.  We will really miss seeing our UT friends.  We really hope that all of you are able to find some normalcy soon.

We love you and miss you already,

Paul, DeeAnne, and Jamil

**I know, everything freaking sucks**.  It really does! This was not the semester we hoped for, the graduation plans we were anticipating and the world we thought we lived in.  I know that some of you are living in precarious situations and many of you are feeling isolated and lost.

I want you to know that University staff (and a lot of University faculty) are working hard to help you get the help and resources you need to make it through the semester. We're still working full time for you.  **We might not be a brief walk away, and we might be virtual, but we're still here to help!** And if you haven't checked out the resources available to you through the [Office of the Dean of Students (or your college), please take a look at them now](https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/about/coronavirus.php). if you need assistance with your living situation or internet connection, Student Emergency Services is working to help students find solutions to finish out the semester.

My office is available to you via email and online  (and so are ALL offices on campus)! And we get that sometimes you send an email and it feels like you're screaming into a void, but I want to make a few suggestions to consider when you reach out to university staff:

**1) 99% of University staff is going to be active online from M-F 8 am-5 pm.** Not at midnight. Not at 3 am on Saturday. If you email me at 3 am? Look, I love my job, and I love all of my students, but you know what I love the most? Not thinking about my job at 3 am on Saturdays. Oh, and *Sleeping*.

We won't be checking our email until (at the earliest) 8 am the following business day, and with morning staff meetings, honestly, it's far more likely we get back to you after 11 am !

That means that you don't need to send a follow up email at 5 am that morning, and that you don't need to send a second follow up to another employee in our office at 8 am.  Obviously we are going to do our best to get back to you as soon as we have an answer or have the ability, but sometimes that might mean that we don't get back to you for 2-3 business days (Yes, I've had students email me with a question, and it's taken 2 days for me to find the answer!).

Standard business practice is to respond to an email within 24 hours, so keep that in mind when you send an email- I'd suggest you wait at least a day before you send a follow-up. (And if you give us a *chance* to respond to your first message - we won't be annoyed about a follow-up email!)

**2) Emailing** ***every single person*** **in a university office with the same question is inappropriate.** We understand that you didn't know you needed X permission to do Y until 5:30 pm on a Sunday, but sending out 15 emails isn't going to get you faster, better results. Advisors talk! We know that you emailed every single advisor in our office with the same question. If you're unsure if the person you're emailing is right, usually staff will be happy to forward your message on to the correct party.

**3) Overall, we really do want to help you! But because of the fact that we serve ALL of you, we can't always put you (the individual) ahead of everyone else in the student body.** That's just not fair to everyone else. If you didn't pay attention to your registration plan and realize last minute that you need assistance from an advisor, we might be busy! You might have to wait. We will work hard to get you in, and assist you in a timely manner, but we're not going to cancel on the students who had the forethought to plan ahead just because your registration is tomorrow.

**4) INCLUDE YOUR EID.** INCLUDE YOUR EID, INCLUDE YOUR EID IN EMAILS!!! *Especially* if you have a generic name and are one of about 600 John Smiths currently registered at UT. Even if you have a unique name, it really really really speeds up the process and we really need you to either put your EID in your email signature or include it in every communication you send us.

Look, advisors are mostly giant extroverted nerds who loved college and never left. We HATE that we're online and by ourselves. We love helping you figure out your classes, troubleshoot your student org issues, telling you that yes, you need to go to tutoring, helping you decide which elective to take during Fall 2020, and hearing about how you turned around your grade in that math class you dropped last semester. We miss you very much and hope that we're all back and safe again soon.  Please just, treat us a little more like people when you reach out to us.

I thought you might like my (not-to-scale) recreation of UT Tower in Minecraft (Survival). I was an exchange student from Germany for two semesters until my stay got cut short by Corona.

I loved my stay in Austin and miss the city, my friends and the campus so much I decided to build the tower on a private server me and my friends have been playing on over the last couple of weeks. I should have used the time to do my projects and study for finals but oh well...

I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy! Good luck with finals!

I am a graduating senior and about an hour and a half ago finished up my last class. I feel nothing and everything at all. I still remember so much, and have gone through an incredible transformation over the last four years here. I wanted to write down my story briefly for you longhorns; I hope you feel comfortable enough to share something as well. 

I come from a small town in Texas, and about only four of our class came to UT. I roomed for three years with one of my best friends, and came into college in a relationships with my then girlfriend. We broke up mid-way through the first semester and it absolutely crushed me. I spent a lot of time isolating, lamenting and being dejected. I was a pretty bad person and so I felt like it was punishment for me to suffer and not enjoy college. I spent most of my time my first two years just studying. I did not make many friends, and the ones I did make I did not keep up with. I played in a sports club but I only made two good friends (still good friends with both). However, most of my time was miserable - I put on weight, struggled with becoming a better person, felt like I didn't deserve much and just wanted to suffer a lot. It was the only sensation I felt really strongly. I didn't have any friends to confide in and just didn't feel like it was worth it. Although this never hurt my studies - I really enjoyed my classes and felt like my professors were the best people in my life. Additionally, I spent much time reflecting and keeping up a journal (which I still do), and reading books. These two things kept me afloat, and actually made me a better person.  

But I realized that holding grudges against myself was wasting so much energy - I was tired of being so sad on purpose and living a miserable life. I started to eat right, work out in the mornings, took up a part time job on campus, and started saying ""yes"" to life more often. Life didn't change magically change or get amazing - but it did get better. I made a few more friends, got nice internships, expanded my network, stayed healthy, got back into my numerous hobbies, went out more and just...lived life. I never did anything I didn't want to, or felt pressured to do something. I made many great memories, and I am thankful for my pain because it gave me wisdom and through that I grew. I am proud of what my four years meant to me, even though it wasn't the most ideal. All my friends have been supportive in their own capacities, and I have grown close to many professors. Everything isn't fine and dandy, but it is better. 

And now it has all come to an end. I really don't know what will happen with commencement. I really don't think it will go through if I am being honest. I am upset my parents won't get to fulfill their own dream of seeing their son graduate and walk. Or that I won't get to take pictures with my professors and friends at graduation. I plan on writing a letter to every professor, TA, and friend that inspired me and meant something to me. This isn't the end of things though. I will also be back here for my dual Master's program, so I am very thankful I don't have to part ways with Austin and UT yet. This isn't the way I imagined it, but that is okay.

Professors want to see a face--teaching to a screen full of names is incredibly discouraging.

If you are able, please turn your cameras on during live lectures. My dad is teaching summer classes and consistently leaves lectures tired, drained, and melancholic. He told me yesterday that lecturing to a void is incredibly discouraging: he has no idea if his students are paying attention and he can’t tell if anything that he’s doing is working. He doesn’t look forward to teaching because he knows he won’t see a single face. The worst part is asking his students a question and waiting to see if someone will answer, feeling ridiculous for being silent and discouraged because he doesn’t know if an answer will come. Zoom lectures are hard, but boy, are they even harder on educators who don’t get to see anyone’s face, much less hear a voice besides their own.

I get the need to not stick out and I know how uncomfortable it is to be the only person with a camera on--trust me, I’m more the ‘works in the background’ type. But I’ve kept my camera on throughout the spring semester because I know that, if I were the one teaching, I would rely on seeing people to have that sense of purpose to teach. By the end of the semester, three of my professors reached out and told me that they appreciated knowing that I would be there--with video on--to help them gauge their pace and clarity and to have a person they could teach to. I’m usually the only one with a camera on, and, tbh, I probably would have turned it off if a professor hadn’t told me how glad they were that they could see at least one of their students.

I’m not guaranteeing that they’ll say something, but honestly, that’s not the point. The point is helping professors and educators get through teaching via zoom. Being the only visible peer is uncomfortable (I speak from experience), but leaving your camera on can make a world of difference for the educator on the other side.

There aren't *that* many posts per day on this subreddit to the point that I feel this level of moderating is necessary.

Also, I noticed them removing admissions related posts since it violates Rule 7, which is fine, but I think that after the closure of r/UTAustinAdmissions, a limited amount of admissions questions should be allowed, as long as they haven't been asked before (ie. use the search bar). Or, the rules should at least link to r/UTAustinAdmissions2.","[0.21401809, 0.77589315]",0.21401809,0.7758931517601013,0.0,0.0,-0.13795000000000002,campus

Tl;dr: if you can, turn on your cameras during live lectures. Professors want to see a face--teaching to a screen full of names is incredibly discouraging.

If you are able, please turn your cameras on during live lectures. My dad is teaching summer classes and consistently leaves lectures tired, drained, and melancholic. He told me yesterday that lecturing to a void is incredibly discouraging: he has no idea if his students are paying attention and he can’t tell if anything that he’s doing is working. He doesn’t look forward to teaching because he knows he won’t see a single face. The worst part is asking his students a question and waiting to see if someone will answer, feeling ridiculous for being silent and discouraged because he doesn’t know if an answer will come. Zoom lectures are hard, but boy, are they even harder on educators who don’t get to see anyone’s face, much less hear a voice besides their own.

I get the need to not stick out and I know how uncomfortable it is to be the only person with a camera on--trust me, I’m more the ‘works in the background’ type. But I’ve kept my camera on throughout the spring semester because I know that, if I were the one teaching, I would rely on seeing people to have that sense of purpose to teach. By the end of the semester, three of my professors reached out and told me that they appreciated knowing that I would be there--with video on--to help them gauge their pace and clarity and to have a person they could teach to. I’m usually the only one with a camera on, and, tbh, I probably would have turned it off if a professor hadn’t told me how glad they were that they could see at least one of their students.

I’m not guaranteeing that they’ll say something, but honestly, that’s not the point. The point is helping professors and educators get through teaching via zoom. Being the only visible peer is uncomfortable (I speak from experience), but leaving your camera on can make a world of difference for the educator on the other side.",igg1od,186,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/igg1od/reminder_help_your_professors_by_turning_on_your/,"Reminder: Help your professors by turning on your camera!

All of my classes are asynchronous. They post the weeks lectures on sundays usually. Most of my classes will publish three videos per week. They say the videos are intended for us to watch during our time slot which has historically been 50 minutes-1 hour.

  For a MWF class, usually the lectures are 50 minutes. T/TH lectures are 75 minutes. I have noticed in just the last week that now my MWF professors are posting upwards of 1.5 hour videos x3 times a week for what is supposed to be a 50-55 minute lecture. I'm sure they think that it shouldn't matter but we are talking about EVERY single class of mine doing this.  I sit down for what should be 3 hours of lectures and it turns into 5.

I know it is tough to be a student much less one in times of covid. I feel for you all. Some students ask me for tips and suggestions for studying and productivity. 

When I came back to school after 8 years of being out, I invested in an external monitor. It changed my productivity immensely. So much so I bought a few more... I know times are tough financially, too, so I’d suggest Craig’s list, Facebook marketplace, goodwill, etc (but do it safely! Tell someone where you’re going to pick it up or better have someone go w you). I’ve gotten monitors from $12-$40. I personally feel it’s totally worth it, especially having to use Zoom. With an extra monitor, you can have the main speaker and other files like PPTs open (or you can see the galley view of your peers). 

Another suggestion to keep going— I tend to work on assignments or study for 1-2 hours then I like to get up, put on some YouTube video, and just jog in place for 10 mins (for me that’s about 1 mile), then get back to work. Keeps me awake, gives me an active break where I don’t feel guilty watching silly YouTube videos, I can get in 30-60 mins of exercise throughout the day, and it just makes me feel good. If that’s not for you, maybe try stretching, or squats, push ups, etc. It’s important to take little breaks to consolidate information and to maintain sanity. 

I hope you all are staying safe and sane and finding ways to connect, engage, and smile. 

Peace, presence, and gratitude. 

I’m here for y’all. 

Cheers!

Do not get complacent. Even if you think your candidate has a clear advantage, vote anyway. Do not make this the election you regret not voting in.

**Vote like your life depends on it**... because it just might.",jgel3a,240,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/jgel3a/please_for_your_fellow_students_your_family_your/,"Please, for your fellow students, your family, your friends, and your future... VOTE! The 2020 general election is rounding to the final stretch: early voting ends Friday, October 30th, just before Election Day on November 3rd.

By now you have made up your mind. Do not wait. Go vote at the earliest possible opportunity. Don't put it off until tomorrow, the end of the week, or Election Day. Queue lines will only get longer if you wait. Even then, don't let long lines intimidate you. We're all in this together, and exercising your right to vote will be well worth any amount of time you have to wait in line.

First off, this has been the absolute time of my life. My home life was pretty rough, and UT has been a whole different world for me. The community is, for the most part, accepting and welcomes folks with open arms as long as you have something to put into your relationships with people. I just wish I could be spending today/the next few days with my friends before we all go our separate ways for a while before we all go full time.

Also, I have some thoughts for those of you who are going to be starting in the fall or are early on in your career at UT:

- It's not a race. Enjoy your time here. Squeeze everything of value that you can out of UT. You're paying for it either way, you might as well get some benefit from it.

- If you're not happy in your current major, make sure it's because you're not happy with your major and not that you've got an underlying problem going on. I never really felt more alone than I did in my freshman/sophomore year as an Economics major and it was a byproduct of some underlying problems that I needed to address before I figured out what direction I needed to go in. Take care of yourself, please.

- Really try in your classes. Your grades will matter for higher-end jobs you may want, and it's worth it to have that 3.6-3.8 when the time comes. 

- Really curate your relationships. I've found that I very much prefer my more insular friend group with about a dozen people in it to a larger, more expansive group of people, and it's easier to balance relationships and there are just fewer issues on the whole among us.

- Just have fun, guys. 

I've had a blast here my last four years, and UT has put me in a position to succeed in my career and get to some of my bigger life goals. I hope it'll do the same for y'all!

**Power:** Facilities on campus will not lose power because UT’s grid can be disconnected from the main grid and still function.

University spokesperson J.B. Bird said there have not been any power outages on campus thus far.

**Water:** According to an Austin Water spokesperson, areas around UT, West Campus and Riverside are not under a boil water notice, and there’s not a concern Austin Water will go under a boil notice because “systems are running pretty smoothly.”

**Finding resources at UT:** The University has created an emergency website that allows students to find out exactly what is available and what the status is for different departments and services.

**Warming centers:** The Texas Union will be open as a warming station from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday. The San Jacinto Residence Hall multipurpose room is also open as a warming station through midnight Tuesday.

Both are only open to UT students.

**Campus food options:** Both Kinsolving Dining and J2 are open for food and shelter through UHD during[ dining hours](https://housing.utexas.edu/dining/hours).

Students without unlimited meal plans will have to pay for food.

**Classes:** UT campus remains closed through at least Thursday, February 18, at 8 a.m.

Professors can still have assignments and tests due once classes resume, but nothing should be due while classes are canceled.

**UHS AND CMHC:** u/HealthyHorns telehealth appointments scheduled through Thursday, February 18, at 8 a.m are cancelled.

Whether it be grade related or about issues making friends. I thought if I shared my story it might make you all feel better and see that no matter how dire their is always a path ahead.


I joined UT Austin from transfer in my sophomore year. I had a meh semester getting around 2.8 GPA. But I had fun and didn’t really plan on grad school. That spring I switched into my major: Government. Not a particularly hard major and on my day I found it interesting. It was in that semester that I procrastinated hardcore. Taking zeros on assignments. Zeros are deadly. I also had my parents cut me off due to my grades the first semester. So what did stupid me do? Took out UT tuition loans because I procrastinated on FAFSA. 

That semester due to my stress and stupidity I had dropped all my courses and started working all the time to try and pay off those loans so I could register the next semester. I didn’t pay them off in time but thankfully UT works with you if you get on a payment plan and I registered but this time using a loan from the federal govt via FAFSA. 

Due to me working 25 hours a week and classes 12 hours I struggled. Ended up after that semester right around a 2.0GPA. Rent also went up during that time and my apartment was now $890 a month. Not a lot to many but when you’re income is $1,250 that $50 increase matters.

Eventually I couldn’t make my payment plan of $250 a month. I had my registration blocked. I decided to go get a job full-time in sales. I did that and am now slowly paying off my debt while taking courses via UT extension (unfortunately I can’t my transcripts to a community college to do courses while under financial bar) to get my degree. It sucks and there’s so many things I wish the younger version of myself did better.

I too entered with big ambition - I had sooo many questions about courses, minors, internal transfers, can I finish on time…. And I had a shit advisor who was just starting out. He got fired by UT during fall of my second year.  I never received any good advice so I stopped going to advising. Instead, I went online or to my friends for degree help. 

Don’t make my mistake. The people inside UT know all the tricks and tips for your degree. They can make magic happen - save a space in classes you need, call other departments, override requirements.. If your advisor isn’t helping, look for another advisor in your department. You can even message other staff, like the Dean of your college (though keep it appropriate; they are busy people!) , if you need extra help. They are approachable, nice, and ready to help you! If you are a UT student, I can guarantee just about any UT staff would help you. They did when I was advisor-less after mine got fired. 

Be aggressive, make a plan, and take the reins of your education. You are paying a lot for this and you should get exactly what you want out of it.

638,osc5xk,"good,hip,utaustin,lofi,athlete,task,inevitable,spots,time,distracted",4.7631749999999995,How to Focus in College,"* Decide what time (s) you can focus best. Some people focus better in the mornings, in the afternoons, evenings, or late nights. Do you get more work done by waking up at 8 AM and grinding through the morning, or do you get more work done staying up late and studying until 3 AM?
* Figure out where you work best. Do you focus best in your dorm? The library? The student union? Outside? Inside? Try out different places and see what works for you.
* Minimize anything that takes up time. Do you drink a lot of water when you study? Work near a water fountain. Do you take a lot of time to break for lunch/dinner? Work near somewhere you can get food. If you’re at the PCL, and you get hungry, have to walk to the drag, find somewhere to eat, order it, wait in line, eat it, and walk back to the PCL, you’ll have lost about an hour. Meanwhile, reaching into your bag for that sandwich you made last night and scarfing it down can be done in less than five minutes (trust me, I would know).
* Cut out all forms of distraction. If your friends blow up your phone, use airplane mode or do not disturb them. If you can't stay off Twitter, delete the app on your phone. Put your phone in your backpack or somewhere you can’t see it. If you absolutely cannot stay off your phone, there is an app, Flora, that has you set a certain amount of time to focus and then charges you money if you use another app. It sounds stupid and crazy, but it worked wonders for me. I couldn't stay off my phone but since I got the app, I have never checked social media while I was studying. There are also extensions that block out distracting sites.
* Decide what sounds you study best to. Do you focus best in complete silence? In the ambient sounds of a cafe? By the hum of an air conditioner? To rock music, rap, classical, or lofi beats? Personally, music distracts me, so I make a point to not bring my headphones with me to study unless I need to watch a video.
* Decide if you study best alone or with other people. When people go out to study with their friends, they usually end up screwing around for hours, getting a fraction of the work done that they would have. However, if you have motivated friends who can focus, and being around them energizes you and helps you focus. Go for it. Decide what works for you, and if you prefer to work alone, don’t lie to yourself -- and don't be afraid to say no to your friends. If you are in a demanding major or career path, studying with friends can help you manage your school and social life. For these kinds of people, balancing social life vs school is more of an integration than a balance.
* Figure out if caffeine works for you. Some people work best after they’ve just chugged a Red Bull or a venti caramel latte. Some people get jittery and have to pee every ten minutes. Be careful, while it can help, caffeine is very addictive and withdrawal symptoms or a caffeine crash can kill your focus.
* Be careful using study drugs like Adderall without a prescription from a doctor. Taking a ton of study drugs before that big exam when you're not used to it will make you geeked. If you're studying, you will zoom through all the material and not remember a thing the next day. If you're sitting in there taking the test, you will confidently put down answers that are completely wrong, or will spend 20 minutes hyper fixating on the third problem. It's your life, but I will warn you that taking drugs all the time to focus can lead to addiction and dependency. Adderall can kill your appetite and make you feel hollow, cranky, and anxious. 
* Use your fears and desires to motivate you. This is called the possible selves. Close your eyes. Imagine yourself as whatever you want to be. Maybe it's a surgeon at some big hospital, an analyst at some fancy bank, a rocket scientist for NASA, or a coder for Facebook. That's what you can be if you ace that test in two days. Now imagine yourself as someone you wouldn’t want to be. Maybe it's someone who failed biology or accounting someone who Goldman Sachs, or Boeing, or Apple, or whatever you wanna do or work for thinks is stupid. That’s what will happen if you keep watching Netflix and don’t turn in that paper that's due at midnight. It sounds harsh, but it works.
* Take care of yourself. Getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep is going to affect your performance. Getting less than 6 hours of sleep is going to DRASTICALLY affect your performance. If you are going to pull an all-nighter and go take a test the next day, good luck. You might as well slam a few beers while you're at it, cause that's how you're going to feel. People who study 24/7 and do nothing else literally snap. It happens. Take breaks. That guy in your compsci class who said he studied for, like 10 hours straight for the final is a liar.

639,osh7sy,"outlines,vehicles,recipe,drag,tip,coop,clothes,i35,alleys,bullets",0.8029324680735931,How to Stay Safe in College,"Disclaimer: I am a man. I will never be able to see the world from the guarded perspective of a woman. However, this is my advice on staying safe during your time at UT.

This advice may seem a little paranoid, but I believe it is better to err on the side of caution. UT is a  very safe environment in general, especially the campus, and it is unlikely that you will ever be in a dangerous situation.

* Know the dangerous areas on campus. The side of the drag that is not part of campus can have some very sketchy people. I avoid walking there alone after dark. The area that is a gap between the Castilian and the businesses on the drag is particularly sketchy. Do not cut through there at night. The bus stop on the campus side of the drag can also be sketchy at night. However, the campus at night is relatively safe. UT offers a service, UT Night rides, that gives you $100 a month in Lyft credit for rides from campus to an off-campus location. Lyft drivers can be creeps. Have your phone out to make sure they're following the route. If they ask you if where you're dropped off is where you live, it isn't. It's your friends/brothers/boyfriend's place.
* Never look lost. I don’t care if you have no idea where you are, you are going to look straight ahead and walk confidently like you're in a hurry to go to an important meeting and you don’t have time for anyone’s BS to make you late.
* Be extremely wary when interacting with homeless people. I am not trying to sound ignorant or rude, but many homeless people in the west campus area are drunk, high, afflicted with mental health problems, or just plain desperate. A few of my friends gave money to a homeless man and he saw the rest of what was in his wallet and demanded he hand it over. Sure, I’ve given extra cash and food to homeless people, but in broad daylight. I would not interact with any homeless people after the sun goes down.
* Carry pepper spray or a taser. Every woman I know has at least one of the two. Whichever you choose, practice being able to get it out quickly and use it. Tasers make a very distinctive sound that is usually enough to ward off anybody trying to harm you. I had a friend who had a man try to grab her and shove her into another man’s car. I get chills thinking of what could have happened to her if she didn’t have her pepper spray.
* Be wary of giving your personal information to people. If someone has your phone number, they can plug it into white pages and get your full name, address, age, relatives, and all kinds of other information. Do not have your phone number publicly showing on Instagram. Do not have your location on snap maps. You can set up a google voice number that cannot be scrubbed for your personal info, and then if you have the app on your phone, it can send texts/calls to the number straight to your phone like it was your real one. You can give the number to creeps who ask for it. 
* Be careful posting your class schedule online. It shows exactly where you will be, at exact hours of the day.
* If a stranger on the street asks you something, and you are not in broad daylight, surrounded by people, keep walking. Do not stop to talk. Answering them is an invitation. If someone asks you something like “you have the time?”, it is likely that they are about to harm you. Anyone telling you a story involving a puppy or other cute animal may be trying to harm you.
* Do not walk around glued to your phone, or wearing headphones. Be aware of your environment at all times.
* Do not accept drinks from strangers that are not completely sealed (such as a can or bottle). Do not drink the jungle juice (communal punch) at a party, it is often either drugged or extremely strong, and then made to cover up the taste of liquor. (or both) If you are at a bar or nightclub, do not accept a drink that you didn't watch the bartender make. If you go to the bathroom and leave your drink, get a new one.
* Be careful when meeting up with a stranger that you met in a romantic environment, like a dating app. Anyone that you met off an app or other similar situation who immediately invites you to their place is going to try to have sex with you. They are not inviting you there to “hang out” “watch a movie” “ “smoke” or “chill”. If you decide to meet up with someone you met online, share your location with a friend. Text them when you are home safely.
* Set clear boundaries with romantic & sexual partners. Do not be afraid to say no in situations in which you are uncomfortable. Sadly, many people think that a lack of a no=consent. Do not allow them to take advantage of you. To my guys out there, the best way to avoid being a creep is to get a clear yes! before doing anything sexual with someone. When someone wants to have sex with you, they will make it very clear. Never think that anybody owes you sex. Never feel that you owe anybody sex. Do not have sex with people who are very drunk. It happens often, but having sex with someone who was plastered can make you look like a creep if they weren't actually into it. Call out your fellow bros when they do things that aren't cool. Listen to your conscience.
* Appearances can fool you. Not every weirdo out there is an ugly old man. Many of them are people you know. People who look ""soft"" can be extremely shitty people. If someone gives you a bad feeling, don't engage with them.
* Trust your gut. Intuition is a skill that we evolved over centuries of survival. Use it. If something feels ""off"" don't do it. It is far better to be safe than sorry.

As a pre-med Biology major, I really struggled with online learning these past 2 semesters and ended the year feeling burnt out and extremely unprepared for the future. I feel like in-person classes and labs are crucial to really grasp the complex scientific topics we are required to know. Now, I feel not at all prepared for the MCAT and medical school and have a lot of catching up to do on my own time. I also decided to stay at home this past year to save money, so I really missed out on meeting new people and establishing lasting connections with professors, something that is crucial for anyone trying to get into a post-grad program. I was beyond excited and happy to return to an in-person schedule to try and make up for the things I lost out on.

SO, all this being said, imagine my disappointment upon hearing the plans for fall 2021 AFTER I had already signed a lease. So far, 4/6 of my classes have announced plans to be online, 2 of them permanently and the other 2 until September 17th, as part of UT's reduced density plan. Let's be real though, based on the trajectory of this pandemic so far, I'm sure that when September rolls around, that date will be extended. What's going to change in 3 weeks? I'm expecting emails from the remaining 2 stating the same plan anytime now. I know that UT, as a Texas public school, is restricted in what decisions it can make, but I'm so frustrated. Paying ridiculous amounts for tuition, rent, parking, etc. for a community college experience (if even)? Not to mention, tuition actually increased this year AND I think the threshold for financial aid decreased (I received way less money this year despite a WORSE financial status?). This school is rich asf okay. No excuses should be made for it. Also, interesting how the big ticket is still being advertised and pushed on us! **If safety was the real concern**, why not put a hold on SPORTS instead of ACADEMICS, the actual reason we're here (btw, the first football game of the year is sponsored by St. David's......hilariously ironic)! 

I understand that the delta variant is extremely aggressive, but that doesn't mean that we, as young adults whose lives are being affected, don't have the right to be frustrated and scared for our futures. I'm tired of people telling us to ""stop complaining."" This virus is not going away. It is something that our society is going to have to live with forever now, like the flu. Delta is definitely not the last variant we're going to see. Are we going to shut the world down every time another pops up? It's unrealistic. At some point we as individuals will have to be in charge of our own health and determine what risks we are willing to take for the sake of living our lives again. I don't really care if people think that's selfish. These are legitimate concerns and being upset is completely valid. I welcome discourse and differing opinions, but please don't comment telling me I'm a horrible selfish person because I promise you are wasting your time. 

It just all feels so disingenuous. If I had known this was the plan, I 100% without a doubt would have stayed home, even if that meant unenrolling at UT and finishing my education elsewhere. Now, I'm stuck paying tens of thousands of dollars to sit in my overpriced apartment on my laptop.

But my friends and I went to the silent disco tonight at Greg. It was pretty low key, but enough people for it to feel safe and such at night. Plus there’s always some people out on speedway at night anyways. So my friend and I are chilling on the side and this guy comes over to sit with us. Initially he seems chill, kinda interesting, whatever. First red flag was that he didn’t even go to UT. He said he was giving his friend a tour of Austin and stopped by campus. Second red flag was that he was obviously significantly older than us and actually showed excitement (ew) when we said we were freshman/sophomores. Then, when we asked him what he does (since he’s apparently not in school), he literally says “you don’t want to know what I do.” Finally after a really awkward few minutes of him calling us “party girls” and “freshies” he asks if we want to go get smoothies?? We both don’t really answer and I think he FINALLY gets the vibe and says he’s gonna go find his friend (who he said was this dude dancing in front of us.) Well when he gets up he goes no where near his “friend” and actually just walks away to a nearby staircase where he sits down and stares at us. 

THEN a group of girls (who were the best people ever like thank you so much for checking on us) comes up to us and repeats everything he told us because he had tried the same lines/story on them JUST BEFORE US. Asking to get smoothies and everything. Lemme just say that gave me freaking chills. We waited for him to get up and leave before even considering walking back to our dorm. 

Anyways. This is tame compared to some situations, I get that. But I just had to say something because I’d never want to hear that some girl actually took him up on the smoothie offer and something happened. And no, there really wasn’t an option to “report” him or anything  as the whole thing was just students (even though I’m honestly thinking I should’ve done more). But just please be careful.

For one thing, it’s obvious to me that these people are not UT students. It’s ok to not know perfect English but whenever I try speaking back at them, they just give blank stares. How these people could be UT students while not knowing any English is beyond me.

Furthermore, it’s always different people but with the same MO. They all wear the same outfit and look like students. They all look like they’re in their upper 20’s or lower 30’s. Same pamphlet. Same “gifts” (crackers or cookies). 

I’ve also had this happen to me in multiple occasions in different locations. They’ve come to me in different floors of the PCL and even around midnight at the EER. 

Some are even a bit aggressive. Just a few minutes ago one lady of this group solicited me and whenever I had to respectfully say no (I’m hella poor) she left in a huff. On the 4th floor of the PCL mind you.

At this point I’m worried about their safety. It could be that these people are not even aware of what they’re doing and are being exploited by some exterior group.

This is creepy to me. I’ll make sure to provide pictures the next time they approach me.


Edit:
After doing some research using the additional information given to me from the comment below. We were able to track down one of the solicitors to a “news anchor” called Princess Laranas using one of the venmo handles they use for donations. This lead us to their official Facebook profile.

Princess Laranas is a news anchor for this group called SMNI News. SMNI is owned and operated by Swara Sug Media Corporation which is the parent company of Sonshine Media Network International. This company is the broadcasting arm for Filipino televangelist and church leader Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy.

Besides making grand claims such as being the “Appointed Son of God” and being the “Owner of the Universe”, Mr. Quiboloy was also accused of brainwashing a former church member, and was indicted for sex trafficking.

Mr. Quiboloy is the founder of the church “Kingdom of Jesus Christ”. This church practices tithing which has made Mr. Quiboloy very wealthy.

Besides that, the church is also guilty of human trafficking, abuse and are required to meet tithing quotas (which is probably why they’re soliciting us for money)

I think it would’ve been better if the PCL wasn’t the only ugly library but you have examples such as the Architectural and Planning Library which is beautiful and has the vibe and warm tones of a library. In contrast, the PCL has very cold dead tones.

The Life Science Library is also another example of a library with a very warm color which feels much more inviting than the PCL.

In general, I think this feeling of coldness is a trend within the newer libraries. The Engineering library in the EER is also guilty of this. But I don’t think this is a valid excuse since the Austin Central Library is arguably much more beautiful than the EER library and the PCL despite being much newer. Maybe the 80’s wasn’t a good time for libraries?

I think where the PCL fails the most is it’s failure to bring in natural light (at least in the study spaces) which leads to its over reliance on white lamps which gives off the cold tones. In contrast, the Architecture library has these wide open windows which bring in a lot of natural lighting.

Maybe the PCL was built to keep our natural light to protect the books, but why the arch library can do this and not the PCL I do not know.

* Kicked out a member of the org who spoke out against their decision and then lied to their members about the reason for her expulsion, despite the survivor's wishes. 
* Stopped mixing with Tejas only after Tejas cut ties with them first and then other spirit groups distanced from Tejas as well.

If you're sitting alone in a dining hall but want to talk with another random person, rotate the paper towel holder 90 degrees. It should be subtle enough so that no one really notices but people who do can come sit with you if they want. Remember to move the holder back to the original position when you leave so anyone who sits later after won't get random people going up to them (would be funny tho).

Any thoughts?

The chances of a person doing this randomly are abysmally low so it might be a better sign.

I don’t know much about AKPsi or PCT, I am just here to warn about DSP. Some issues in the past few semesters: 

- Dozens of members defended a sexual assaulter and attempted to silence the victim
- Regular problems with sexual assault at parties
- They don’t value you and outcast you if you’re not into banking or consulting 
- Bullied pledges into dropping 
- Multiple racist comments and jokes, harassing people in front of the whole organization to the point of tears. 
- Members have been kicked out for making KKK jokes and current members in positions of power (ex. the pledge educator) say the n-word. 
- Bullying and excluding gay members 
- Slut-shaming female members, tons of double standards. They have a tradition called ""paper plates"" where members anonymously harass each other on a Powerpoint played for the whole org where they call each other whores and other names or make lewd comments.

Hazing examples:
- Making you put pledging above grades, then putting you down for not having a 4.0 during pledging (people have dropped classes just to continue pledging) 
- Sleep deprivation, making you wake up really early
- Constant belittling and older members taking advantage of pledges and making them do things
- Forced alcohol consumption
- “Grooming” the pledges who older members thought were attractive. There have been multiple instances of a pledge educator or older member who started sleeping with or dating a pledge. 
- Inappropriate comments / sexual harassment of pledges
- Huge one was forcing you to tell the entire organization your traumas (things like sexual assault stories, substance abuse, sickness, etc) so that you can “raise money better” for “community service.” If you didn't do it, they claimed you weren't passionate enough about it.  
- Pitting pledges against each other, spreading rumors about them and making judgements about them to their peers 
- “Pimping” female pledges who are typically young freshman out on Sixth street to sell water bottles to drunk men, putting them at risk of assault. Male pledges were even told to “stand by” in case someone was assaulted.

Overall, TX DSP is an organization that values image over the safety and well-being of its members. They preach diversity and inclusion, but say and do things that make anyone that is not a straight male in finance uncomfortable. 

They lure you in with this illusion of “helping you with professionalism” and getting you your dream job, but in reality it’s just a group of people who make you feel so bad if you don’t have an internship that you get one and then feel like you got it because of them. If you want a hyper-competitive toxic culture of people who keep you on your toes, Delta Sigma Pi is for you but otherwise, don’t do it. You will do just fine recruitment-wise with the resources Mccombs/Internet offers. 

Members have been dropping left and right, don’t waste your time. Also, they haze pretty hard and bully their pledges to force them to trauma-bond with the organization. 

The environment of DSP is a constant cycle of suffering and bullying. People feel like they can’t leave because they’ve been through so much (trauma bonding) and isolated themselves from other support systems because the process of pledging is so time consuming and taxing on your mental and physical health. It’s common for people to lose their relationships and friendships outside of DSP, get sick, and have breakdowns while pledging. Then they take out all this anger on their peers or the next pledge class and the cycle repeats. I have heard many times things like “I want them to go through what we went through” or silencing the pledges when they speak up by saying “I had it worse.”

Also I want to emphasize that this is meant to be a warning and help students who want to join a business fraternity weigh their options. A lot of people who join these organizations are young, impressionable freshman who are very easy to exploit. As soon as we join, our entire life becomes this organization until we graduate and we think that being bullied and harassed by our peers regularly is normal. I wish that someone had warned me before I joined, and I hope this post can be that warning for others.

This is not to say that there are no benefits to joining. Some good things are having a large network of people to reach out to, knowing people in your classes, knowing people who have worked at certain companies, and its definitely possible to make genuine friendships. But once again, these are also things you can get from other resources without your mental health tanking for four years. If you are still interested in being a part of this, I recommend really doing your research and keeping your relationships outside of DSP strong. Prioritize your other interests and your health.

Domino has been wheezing and having trouble breathing for the past week or so. 

Although he is very resistant to trapping, [Cats of West Campus](https://www.facebook.com/catsofwestcampus/posts/4887666241287347) caught him tonight and took him to the vet.

He has an upper respiratory infection, which has affected his lungs as well. Unfortunately, he also tested positive for [FIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus). He was having trouble fighting off the respiratory infection due to reduced immune response from the FIV. 

It is pretty common for outdoor male cats to have FIV. He probably caught FIV at some point in the last few years (since his last vet visit) from fighting another male cat. He has had fight wounds a couple times in the past year. (We tried to take him to the vet to treat the wounds, but he was just impossible to catch. We treated him with antibiotic ointment and his wounds healed without requiring a vet visit.)

There were much more immediately dangerous possibilities, such as heart disease or cancer. His breathing sounded so bad, the vet warned me that chances could be grim. So I consider this diagnosis to be pretty good news. 

He is currently fostering with a UT employee, crashing in a bathroom so he can get some rest and medications. Hopefully the antibiotics will knock out this infection. He is in good hands. Huge thanks to his foster for doctoring him!

I paid $1,000 for the vet bill and will be posting a gofundme soon. God bless the fine folks at Pet Specialists of Austin!

The Domino Council has not made an official decision, but due to Domino's advanced age (approx 13 years old) and FIV+ status, I personally believe it is time for him to retire on a comfy couch. He deserves a happy retirement and easier access to vet care the next time he gets sick. Living outdoors brings many risks and dangers for any cat. He has had a good long run as undisputed King of the Campus. 

We will continue to keep you posted with any news. 

Get well soon, little buddy.

Long Live Domino!

I live in a 3 person dorm room and honestly cannot bear to live with my roommates anymore. My other two roommates are really close friends with each other. If either of them makes a roommate mistake, it’s usually just excused without any major confrontation. But if I make a minor mistake, which happens rarely, I get yelled at a lot for not only that mistake, but also so many other things unrelated to the mistake (most of which are personal and not really something to get angry at, such as my decision to distance myself from them). 

There have been 3 times total where their temper tantrums have occurred, and they keep justifying these fits of yelling by throwing out baseless accusations. I will be honest, despite my efforts to be considerate, I have made a few mistakes, as have they. I understand if I make a minor mistake and they get annoyed. But there has rarely ever been a civil confrontation; they almost always go straight to yelling. They spend months talking to each other behind my back, and the negativity they harbor is unleashed when they lash out at me for making a mistake.

At this point, I have made 2 attempts to talk to them about how I feel about this kind of hostility directed towards me, but nothing has changed. The response has been that I should feel lucky because they “had it in their mind to do worse but didn’t”. The last time one of them yelled at me was two weeks ago (I apologized and tried talking to her about it last Thursday and she just walked out on me mid-conversation). Ever since that tantrum I cannot sleep in the dorm because I feel so anxious being around her. I get a sinking feeling every time I enter the room. I usually sleep in another room or go home on the weekends. I really want to have my own space where I don’t feel under constant threat of getting verbally attacked. I have been significantly sleep deprived and it has really affected my mental health negatively.

I think I should put right here in the beginning that I'm likely not going to drop out. I'm going to keep trying at least for a while. I am a freshman (technically a sophomore) at UT. I have been depressed for a very long time but now it feels out of control. It's gotten to a point where I no longer feel sadness but just complete loss of hope. There is very little positive stimuli in my life and I feel like everyone around me is just complaining as well. I'm going to college because I dont have enough of a resume and am not confident in my skill enough to get a good job otherwise. 

I have a lot of friends but not a single one I am comfortable complaining to. I'd rather complain at the internet because at least I don't have to worry about their personal lives. 

I don't even have the energy to go to classes. I just skip, do all the assigned work, and try my best to learn at home without the instructors help. I live far from campus so I don't want to make to commute when 3 steps out of my bed is hard enough. 

I honestly wanna kill myself but I made a whole bunch of people promises I wouldn't. 

I feel so powerless here. I feel like my emotional health doesn't matter because I have to occupy my girlfriend's problems first. I know her problems are valuable and I care about her. But often in the haze in in, her problems are so easy to fix and I feel like my problems are shrouded by my mental illness and feel like constant battles rather than issues with defined solutions. 

My sister is going through the same stuff at the same time but I can't talk to her. Shes taking on the weight of the world right now and I can't add more.

My parents don't ever understand and are stressed enough about my sister.

I feel like I'm being torn up from the inside. I have connections, I have people who want to help, I have a girlfriend. They all feel too busy though. 

I take meds but they aren't enough. 

I try to change my lifestyle but every few weeks I make one little slip and I'm back here where I started. 

College doesn't care about experience in the field and only cares about grades so no matter how hard I show them that I've been programming for years, they don't seem to want to allow me to do computer science. 

The only things I'm looking forward to are releasing my game on steam and drawing. 

I don't wanna look at people in the eyes anymore. I don't think I've made a friend at UT yet (thankfully I have plenty.) I don't think I've been happy in a long while. 

I don't know what I'm complaining about. Life just seems aimless right now. I want to be a fashion designer, I don't want to work for some other company. Honestly no. I just want to be able to mind my own business in peace.

My parents are kind, my friends are kind, my girlfriend is kind. They'd all be understanding. But I can't tell them how I'm feeling because I want them to be happier. I hate when people contribute negativity to me. I don't want to contribute negativity to them. I love them.

My grades suck in school. 

I'm maybe passing 3 of my 5 classes right now. Maybe less. 

UT won't ever recognize that I'm really good at coding though because they see my grades.

Don't sign a lease here unless you're deaf.,"First off, there’s a courtyard in the middle of the “U-shaped” complex. Sounds great right? Events and more, right outside your apartment. That’s the problem! All that separates at least 50% of the units from the courtyard is the windows, so even a conversation at a normal level can be easily heard. And during the fall semester, there were parties in the courtyard every weekend (even one during finals week) so you can imagine how that was. At least I can give credit to the management for sending an email threatening to call the police on any noise violators beyond that point, so there have been much fewer parties this semester.

But even without noise in the courtyard, the walls AND floors/ceilings are paper thin. And it’s shared walls galore. Wanna study in peace? Not gonna happen if your roommate or neighbors are having a conversation. Wanna sleep? Not until your upstairs neighbors do, because you’ll hear them walking around. Even the sound of a drawer opening is clearly audible. 

Okay, let’s say you got lucky and your neighbors and roommates are dead silent. Too bad! You’ll get woken up by a garbage truck at 7:30 AM. Alright, well perhaps that gives you more time to study. Then you get interrupted by the SECOND garbage truck that makes its rounds at 10 AM.

Maybe you’ve got something important on Friday and you need to get some sleep. Well, only if you can sleep through the music that’s blasted by the co-ops that surround 21 Pearl.

Other than the cheap construction which results in unbearable noise, I don’t have much to complain about. 

Extra notes:

I’m pretty sure this is not how all apartments are. Some are built mostly of concrete which is a lot better at isolating noise.

The water heater and HVAC are all-electrical. Don’t need to worry about a gas bill but it’s more costly to run heating.

When it rains, the courtyard gets mildly flooded so you’ll probably have to walk through a puddle to get to your apartment.

How is it fair for someone to think they have found their home when they may have not? Sure students can hustle for a 4.0, but they earned their spot here and they deserve to keep it or at least have transfer requirements not be so extremely intense. They shouldn’t have to earn their spot here again if things change.

UT is a public ivy, people work really hard to get into schools at this level. You can’t even declare your major at actual ivy league schools until your second year. I feel like the mission of UT Austin in changing the world could be a lot more effective if students could more easily explore their many passions, and thus most effectively pursue their internets. 

You can take a UT degree, majors, minors, activities pretty far, but it is unrealistic to think all entering students have their lives figured out. What’s the point in exploring the breadth of a core curriculum if you can’t change majors to something that sparks your interest? I also think it’s harmful for mental health for people to have to worry about keeping perfect grades to have transfer opportunities. I went through some pretty nasty stuff keeping my 4.0 during the pandemic. 

This is coming from someone who likes both AET and business realizing the path to a business major is realistically gone if my interests change (I know my limits and an internal transfer is not happening). Granted, there are many degree and schools and internship paths to both industries and I am a perfectionist, but that doesn’t take away from the inherent worry or feeling like I might have made a mistake picking majors in my application. The grass is always greener on the other side but questioning what I really want to major in. And many students, like me, have their heart set on UT. I really like this school, and there are many paths to eventually study here, and I want to do something here someday wether that is undergrad or masters or certificate. Not trying to hate on the school, this place seems really awesome and a great fit for me. I really want to go here. Just wish there was more safety in exploration.

But no, she kept going on and on every time I saw her about how I needed to take the heritage course. All the fucking time all she would do is go on and on about how I had to take the heritage class. So yeah I took it and in dying. I’m failing half the assignments even though I speak Spanish without an accent. This clase is so brain numbingly hard that I spend so long always working on my reading and writing, doing all this extra work to help me. Switching up my music patterns. Writing extra shit in Spanish. All this work I’m always doing gets me fucking nowhere. Everyday I feel more and more disconnected to my identity and my language even though I carry my INE in my wallet as a Mexican citizen. I didn’t want to take this course but I felt that I would be moved anyway if I tried to take the other course. I actually fucking wanted to learn Spanish when I came in, not I dread using it at any time. 

And to add on to that I keep on waking up and suddenly remembering I’m disabled. Having a vivid dream where I’m able to walk around and live a life not think about constant leg pain leads into the most crushing feeling of suffocation when I wake up and I feel that ache.

The last time I was able to take a piss without existential suffering. Every moment I spend on my feet is nothing short of pain.

Why I’m this young with so much potential life ahead of me and yet I can live none of it I do not know. No walks around the block to clear my head. No getting around anywhere on my own two feet. Constant worry about leaving the bike friendly environment of UT. Every time I rage at Spanish worms I storm off and then the pain hits and I just feel so hopeless. I’m damned to fail another assignment if I’d stay seated and work, I’m cursed with pain if I walk away. I just wanna be able to get an education and be a functioning member of society but I feel like that’s just a myth now.

I didn't talk or interact with them at all, but still thought that I'd ask to study with them. I wasn't expecting to get a yes, but rather it was because I know just interacting with people makes me happy. And as usual, the moment class was over I just got up and left without saying a word. 

After class, I had nowhere to be, nothing to do, no plans with anyone. I walk around feeling like an idiot, looking at the people passing by and feeling so small and continuously convincing myself that this is a passing phase and that my self-worth doesn't depend on the experiences I'm having. But WHY do I ALWAYS have to be the one to do all the heavy lifting? Why do I always have to be the one to reach out and put myself out there. I know it's silly, and I can't have any expectations but I'm just so tired of feeling like I have to bear the weight of meeting new people all on myself.

I know the blanket statement about joining orgs but it felt like all the cards were stacked against me this semester despite feeling the best about myself that I have felt in a long time.

I tried going to some meetings with my student association, and I know I am definitely projecting my insecurities a little bit, but it felt like everyone was in an tight knit clique throwing sides eyes at the weird, insecure kid trying too hard to find friends.

I want to summarize a few things to make it easier for prospective students, and if I miss anything, please feel free to chip in!

1) What major are you? If you are going to go to law or medical school, it does not really matter for example since you will need more schooling anyways to get a job in the field. However, for engineers, business majors, CS, liberal arts, etc there’s much less of a requirement that you go to graduate school and then it becomes more important where your degree is from.

2) How much would living at home bother you? Commonly it’s your hometown school that gives you a full ride or free tuition, etc. Some people don’t mind at all or might even prefer living with their parents still, some might do it to save money. Either way, for the majority, it is a worse experience, so you need to think if that is something you would be okay with doing or not. And keep in mind, dorms and even just eating together are great ways to socialize and develop friendships.  

3) How much money do you have and how much do loans bother you? I know taking out a $25,000 loan at this age might seem like a lot, and it is, but if UT improves your job prospects, you can more than get your money’s worth. It’s mostly just those who get a degree that they don’t use or those who don’t graduate that get into trouble with their loans. But at the same time, if having a loan would make you anxious, maybe avoid taking one on. 

4) Realize UT is much tougher academically than any regional school in Texas.  Classes will be challenging. Especially in STEM classes, you will not make a 4.0 unless you get all the best professors and have an incredible work ethic and natural intelligence. But that also means you will get to go into more interesting topics in a lot of classes than you would at another school. 

5) If sports interest you at all go to UT. The only other public schools in Texas that have worthwhile sports are Tech and UH. Like for example, UTD has d3 sports. That means their basketball games get a few hundred fans while a UT one could get 10,000. Again, that doesn’t matter to many people, but for me personally, that was a huge factor in my decision.

6. If you did not get your preferred major at UT and are planning to transfer into McCombs, CS, Engineering or any of the notoriously hard majors to transfer into then you should seriously consider your other choices besides UT. If you get into a fairly selective program at a less good school, that is generally better than coming to UT undeclared or as a liberal arts major with the goal of internal transferring.

After that, I sat with myself and my journal for the first time in a while, and wrote about just how tired I was with all of my inaction. The intensity of my feelings felt a little silly when I thought rationally about the people in my life. There are people from other classes I have wanted to hangout with but just haven't reached out. I have my own friends with whom I always just get food instead of trying uncomfortable stuff like going kayaking, or playing a sport together for fun.

A friend of mine reached out to me and said he was gathering some friends to go to Zilker to play ultimate. I really, really didn't want to go -- I have never played ultimate frisbee, I haven't seen these guys in ages and know they have internships and stuff and are doing well in their classes, and I was just terrified. But I wouldn't see this old friend again for months if I didn't go, so I sucked it up and went... and as any person who has fought the urge to stay home knows, I am so glad that I did.

Throughout the hangout, I still felt some insecurities about being bad, and about not making the funniest jokes or not being the smartest. But I feel like these are bad habits that my brain resorts to in these situations because it's just what feels like home. Because in reality, I was outside the house with my OG CS pod friends I hadn't seen in ages, I was running around feeling the cool breeze and the sun on my face, and I was just having fun. Afterwards, we heard about the COIN concert and went despite not having heard their music, and I did not know how much I liked being at a pop concert. I was jumping and yelling and dancing and just finally letting myself relax and enjoy. To be fair, it was fairly tame and I was pretty burnt out of my social energy by the end, but I am just very proud of myself for going.

Next week, I am excited to finally catch up with a few people that I haven't seen in so long. Today, I asked someone out on a date and got rejected and I have never felt so happy about being rejected. I am having a tough time writing this post because all my emotions of feeling scared and anxious and insecure are still there. Of course I'm a little sad about not seeing that person again/things being awkward. It's still very difficult for me to cross the bridge of actually doing shit, or even to pick which bridge to cross. But I feel like when you do, there really is a pot of gold that lies beyond it. The gold isn't finally getting a date to cure your loneliness. Nor is it finally having a perfect friend group. Or even getting into that acapella group you wanted.

I'll start with u/Mysterious-Ant-5889's assertion that 
> The greatest hurdle to getting a CS degree from UT Austin is overcoming the mental abuse of Norman's class

Leaving aside whether Norman's 439 can be classified as ""mental abuse"" I 100% agree with this statement. CS 439 is a weed out class. 

The truth is that most other top 10 CS programs (think UIUC, Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, CMU etc) use their equivalent of CS 314 (data structures) class as a weed out instead. Students who can't hack spending 30-40 hrs/week on a class will find out in their freshman year and proactively transfer/be forced out of the CS major. Whether you think this is fair/moral for schools to do won't change the fact that this is what's currently happening. Look at Berkeley's data structures projects and tell me that's not a weed out - you'll spend 30-40 hrs on them(or at least the final one), easily.

UT CS saves this gauntlet for your second semester of sophomore year (first semester of sophomore year if you hit the ground running in CS 314), when the cost of dropping the CS major is far higher. Whether you think this is fair/moral for UT to do won't change the fact that this is what's currently happening.

Another point from u/Mysterious-Ant-5889:

> The class needs to be heavily revised. You don't need to work 30hrs/week on PintOS to understand the content. The content is pretty easy to understand through practice problems and lectures at 10hrs/week or less.

I respectfully disagree. Real world computer systems and the protocols they use are hellishly complex and getting a basic understanding of their fundamentals requires considerably more than 10hr/wk. If you want to debate, you're free to start doing serious hacking on a project like the Linux kernel or QEMU. They make PintOS look like a CS 312 ""Hello World"" program. Then move on to distributed systems which is OS x N where N is the number of systems involved.

>I had a median pay non-intern Full Stack 25hr/week SWE job during the course 

Here's the truth: the culture of a university like UT is that the university and its professors assume that students are NOT working a 25hr/wk job that isn't provided by UT itself. Mostly they assume UT students' only ""job"" is being a UT student. Whether you think this is fair/moral for UT to not accommodate part time/externally employed students won't change the fact that this is what's currently happening.

u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 sets 10hr/wk to be the bar. 10 is a nice round number and it's probably the minimum limit of effort you can be forced to put into a class, work an outside job and still learn *something* rather than being a complete joke of a class. 

Luckily we find out the *real* reason for the ""classes shouldn't require more than 10hr/wk of effort"" battle cry in another comment:

> No other required CS course exceeds 10hrs/week. I'm glad to see that you're getting why this would be traumatic for loads of students. 

I disagree with the letter of the statement in that I think 10hr/wk is a bit too low, but I actually agree with its spirit.

In fact u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 has identified what I *heavily* suspect is the #1 pain point of OS for UT CS students: **OS is the first truly difficult CS class, where it's hard to even get a B-. Most UT CS classes you can get a B or B- with only medium effort (let's say ~20 hrs/week or less, I speak from personal experience), but that's not even gonna get you a C in OS.** Thus students are completely unprepared for its difficulty.

I put a lot of blame for this on CS 429, which (at least when I took it) completely failed to prepare students for the rigor of CS 439. Bill Young is extremely knowledgeable in his field, sadly his 429 class didn't reflect the depth of his knowledge. When I took 429, you could muddle through with less than 30 hours of C coding in the *entire* semester and barely knowing what a pointer and a segfault were. Going into OS which requires 30+ hrs of C coding *per project* and a solid grasp of pointers, you can see why students struggle so much in 439 - they're learning new OS stuff + stuff they should've learned in 429!

All I know is that other than a *good* 10 minute explanation from Mike Scott (amazing prof btw) near the end of 314 which I'm sure most students forgot, the only in depth lecture I got about pointers was in Glenn Downing's (also amazing prof) OOP class - which you can't take until *after* 429 and you *wouldn't* want to take with OS. Manual memory management is the biggest danger and footgun of C programming that trips up experienced kernel engineers. Why UT CS thinks it's ok to neglect teaching students this in their first ""close to the hardware"" class is beyond me.

Anecdotally, from speaking to students from other top ranked programs and UT students who took 429H with Gheith, their computer architecture classes were much more rigorous and better preparation for a difficult systems course.

Looking at Dr. Young's website today, it looks like he's no longer teaching 429 and there's a new 429 prof named Chatterjee. Maybe Chatterjee has really upped 429's rigor - current students will have to comment. 

u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 also compares 439 with other top schools' classes:
>Ultimately we could rip off Stanford's CS110 (which is ripped from UWash https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/19sp/) just like we did PintOS and have a much higher quality program

Comparing 439 to UW's CSE 373 is misleading - if you read CSE 373 schedule and syllabus, it's a Data Structures class, not a systems one. If anything, it looks harder than 314 and 311. There is a legitimate argument that 314 should be harder since data structures is used literally all the time in CS while the more specialized knowledge from OS comes up more rarely.

Stanford's CS110 is a better comparison but IMO it's still an inaccurate comparison. UT calls 439 ""Principles of Computer Systems"" but it's ham fistedly an OS class. Topics related to other parts of the sytems field are duct taped on near the end and you never implement them (which should make u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 happy since you can totally understand stuff like networks and distributed systems in less than 10 hrs/wk!!! why do people get PhDs studying this stuff?) Also some of the CS110 projects are *harder* or just different versions of stuff you do in 439 - like make a shell or make a filesystem. 

UIUC's CS 423: Operating System Design, https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs423/sp2021/
which they also cited is a much better comparison. There's a real debate to be had about whether an OS class should focus on having students build the fundamental parts of an OS kernel (like in 439) or sink their teeth into a real kernel, like the Linux kernel. I think u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 is underestimating how much effort the UIUC class's projects require since they involve a code base that's orders of magnitude more complex than PintOS's.

439 is best compared with other top schools' OS classes, and I assure, they're not slacking. If anything they might require *more* effort than 439 - ask people from CMU and MIT if you don't believe me.

u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 also brings up Gheith:
>Knowing that Gheith doesn't absolutely destroy your life for 4 months after going through an absolute hellscape with Norman's version of the class makes it all feel so much worse. 

Having talked to students who took 429H and 439H with Gheith, while Gheith is an amazing professor who teaches you a lot, his classes are even harder than 429 with Young or 439 with Norman. 

So after defending the honor of 439, I do have complaints about it and how it can be improved:

**How 439 can be improved**

* UT CS classes need to ramp up difficulty in a logical way. It bears repeating: **OS is the first truly difficult CS class, where it's hard to even get a B-. Most UT CS classes you can get a B or B- with only medium effort, but that's not even gonna get you a C in OS.** 

This isn't acceptable. Difficulty should ramp up with each progressing class so students don't fall off the OS cliff. Think 20hrs/wk for 314, 30 hrs/wk for 429 so the advance to 40hrs/wk in 439 won't be nearly as stressful.

* Pointers and C programming need to be hammered in during 429, not learned on the fly in 439

It's not ok that I walked out of 429 with a B but was barely able to implement a linked list in C at the beginning of 439 (I know I'm not the only student who had this problem)

* Increase TAs for 439

Since 439 is the first truly difficult required CS class, office hours are flooded even with the 6-10 TAs 439 has. There's a very real risk that even if you show up when office hours start, you won't get a slot. My OS team tried to go to office hours and several times gave up when we realized we were too late to get a slot. Luckily we resolved problems without the TAs help but this happening multiple times isn't ok.

* More emphasis on OS concepts that don't deal directly with kernels

It's a shame that it's not until grad OS with Chris Rossbach that you're exposed to the idea that any sufficiently big system eventually becomes an OS. The moment you start writing ""software that manages other software"" you're closing in on OS territory, even if the management software isn't called an OS. Browsers, the thing you're reading my writing on right now, have arguably become mini OSes. Maybe this will make OS a bit more relevant to u/Mysterious-Ant-5889's full stack job.

Leaving aside whether Norman's 439 can be classified as ""mental abuse"" I 100% agree with this statement. CS 439 is a weed out class. 

The truth is that most other top 10 CS programs (think UIUC, Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, CMU etc) use their equivalent of CS 314 (data structures) class as a weed out instead. Students who can't hack spending 30-40 hrs/week on a class will find out in their freshman year and proactively transfer/be forced out of the CS major. Whether you think this is fair/moral for schools to do won't change the fact that this is what's currently happening. Look at Berkeley's data structures projects and tell me that's not a weed out - you'll spend 30-40 hrs on them(or at least the final one), easily.

UT CS saves this gauntlet for your second semester of sophomore year (first semester of sophomore year if you hit the ground running in CS 314), when the cost of dropping the CS major is far higher. Whether you think this is fair/moral for UT to do won't change the fact that this is what's currently happening.

Another point from u/Mysterious-Ant-5889:

> The class needs to be heavily revised. You don't need to work 30hrs/week on PintOS to understand the content. The content is pretty easy to understand through practice problems and lectures at 10hrs/week or less.

I respectfully disagree. Real world computer systems and the protocols they use are hellishly complex and getting a basic understanding of their fundamentals requires considerably more than 10hr/wk. If you want to debate, you're free to start doing serious hacking on a project like the Linux kernel or QEMU. They make PintOS look like a CS 312 ""Hello World"" program. Then move on to distributed systems which is OS x N where N is the number of systems involved.

>I had a median pay non-intern Full Stack 25hr/week SWE job during the course 

Here's the truth: the culture of a university like UT is that the university and its professors assume that students are NOT working a 25hr/wk job that isn't provided by UT itself. Mostly they assume UT students' only ""job"" is being a UT student. Whether you think this is fair/moral for UT to not accommodate part time/externally employed students won't change the fact that this is what's currently happening.

u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 sets 10hr/wk to be the bar. 10 is a nice round number and it's probably the minimum limit of effort you can be forced to put into a class, work an outside job and still learn *something* rather than being a complete joke of a class. 

Luckily we find out the *real* reason for the ""classes shouldn't require more than 10hr/wk of effort"" battle cry in another comment:

> No other required CS course exceeds 10hrs/week. I'm glad to see that you're getting why this would be traumatic for loads of students. 

I disagree with the letter of the statement in that I think 10hr/wk is a bit too low, but I actually agree with its spirit.

In fact u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 has identified what I *heavily* suspect is the #1 pain point of OS for UT CS students: **OS is the first truly difficult CS class, where it's hard to even get a B-. Most UT CS classes you can get a B or B- with only medium effort (let's say ~20 hrs/week or less, I speak from personal experience), but that's not even gonna get you a C in OS.** Thus students are completely unprepared for its difficulty.

I put a lot of blame for this on CS 429, which (at least when I took it) completely failed to prepare students for the rigor of CS 439. Bill Young is extremely knowledgeable in his field, sadly his 429 class didn't reflect the depth of his knowledge. When I took 429, you could muddle through with less than 30 hours of C coding in the *entire* semester and barely knowing what a pointer and a segfault were. Going into OS which requires 30+ hrs of C coding *per project* and a solid grasp of pointers, you can see why students struggle so much in 439 - they're learning new OS stuff + stuff they should've learned in 429!

All I know is that other than a *good* 10 minute explanation from Mike Scott (amazing prof btw) near the end of 314 which I'm sure most students forgot, the only in depth lecture I got about pointers was in Glenn Downing's (also amazing prof) OOP class - which you can't take until *after* 429 and you *wouldn't* want to take with OS. Manual memory management is the biggest danger and footgun of C programming that trips up experienced kernel engineers. Why UT CS thinks it's ok to neglect teaching students this in their first ""close to the hardware"" class is beyond me.

Anecdotally, from speaking to students from other top ranked programs and UT students who took 429H with Gheith, their computer architecture classes were much more rigorous and better preparation for a difficult systems course.

Looking at Dr. Young's website today, it looks like he's no longer teaching 429 and there's a new 429 prof named Chatterjee. Maybe Chatterjee has really upped 429's rigor - current students will have to comment. 

u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 also compares 439 with other top schools' classes:
>Ultimately we could rip off Stanford's CS110 (which is ripped from UWash https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/19sp/) just like we did PintOS and have a much higher quality program

Comparing 439 to UW's CSE 373 is misleading - if you read CSE 373 schedule and syllabus, it's a Data Structures class, not a systems one. If anything, it looks harder than 314 and 311. There is a legitimate argument that 314 should be harder since data structures is used literally all the time in CS while the more specialized knowledge from OS comes up more rarely.

Stanford's CS110 is a better comparison but IMO it's still an inaccurate comparison. UT calls 439 ""Principles of Computer Systems"" but it's ham fistedly an OS class. Topics related to other parts of the sytems field are duct taped on near the end and you never implement them (which should make u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 happy since you can totally understand stuff like networks and distributed systems in less than 10 hrs/wk!!! why do people get PhDs studying this stuff?) Also some of the CS110 projects are *harder* or just different versions of stuff you do in 439 - like make a shell or make a filesystem. 

UIUC's CS 423: Operating System Design, https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs423/sp2021/
which they also cited is a much better comparison. There's a real debate to be had about whether an OS class should focus on having students build the fundamental parts of an OS kernel (like in 439) or sink their teeth into a real kernel, like the Linux kernel. I think u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 is underestimating how much effort the UIUC class's projects require since they involve a code base that's orders of magnitude more complex than PintOS's.

439 is best compared with other top schools' OS classes, and I assure, they're not slacking. If anything they might require *more* effort than 439 - ask people from CMU and MIT if you don't believe me.

u/Mysterious-Ant-5889 also brings up Gheith:
>Knowing that Gheith doesn't absolutely destroy your life for 4 months after going through an absolute hellscape with Norman's version of the class makes it all feel so much worse. 

Having talked to students who took 429H and 439H with Gheith, while Gheith is an amazing professor who teaches you a lot, his classes are even harder than 429 with Young or 439 with Norman. 

So after defending the honor of 439, I do have complaints about it and how it can be improved:

**How 439 can be improved**

* UT CS classes need to ramp up difficulty in a logical way. It bears repeating: **OS is the first truly difficult CS class, where it's hard to even get a B-. Most UT CS classes you can get a B or B- with only medium effort, but that's not even gonna get you a C in OS.** 

This isn't acceptable. Difficulty should ramp up with each progressing class so students don't fall off the OS cliff. Think 20hrs/wk for 314, 30 hrs/wk for 429 so the advance to 40hrs/wk in 439 won't be nearly as stressful.

* Pointers and C programming need to be hammered in during 429, not learned on the fly in 439

It's not ok that I walked out of 429 with a B but was barely able to implement a linked list in C at the beginning of 439 (I know I'm not the only student who had this problem)

* Increase TAs for 439

Since 439 is the first truly difficult required CS class, office hours are flooded even with the 6-10 TAs 439 has. There's a very real risk that even if you show up when office hours start, you won't get a slot. My OS team tried to go to office hours and several times gave up when we realized we were too late to get a slot. Luckily we resolved problems without the TAs help but this happening multiple times isn't ok.

* More emphasis on OS concepts that don't deal directly with kernels

It's a shame that it's not until grad OS with Chris Rossbach that you're exposed to the idea that any sufficiently big system eventually becomes an OS. The moment you start writing ""software that manages other software"" you're closing in on OS territory, even if the management software isn't called an OS. Browsers, the thing you're reading my writing on right now, have arguably become mini OSes. Maybe this will make OS a bit more relevant to u/Mysterious-Ant-5889's full stack job.

EDIT: I'm informed Chatterjee has significantly upped the level of 429, so hopefully my first 2 improvement suggestions are no longer necessary. The last 2 improvements still stand as-is.","[0.10700128, 0.06101985, 0.75016075, 0.08181811]",0.10700128,0.06101984903216362,0.7501607537269592,0.0818181112408638,0.06532537313432836,class_related

I'm Robert Quigley, [a journalism professor](https://moody.utexas.edu/faculty/robert-j-quigley) in Moody who is teaching a new class this fall called ""True Crime Podcasts."" I have expertise in this because I also founded The Drag, a podcast production house based out of Moody that has made two popular true crime pods, [Darkness](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/darkness/id1520789736) (seasons one and two).

The new class is listed as J330M True Crime Podcasts (unique: 08950). It will meet MW (in person) from 3 to 4:30 p.m. It has perquisite journalism classes listed, but **we are not enforcing those prerequisites.** Any undergraduate at UT of good standing can take this course.

I'm working on the structure of the class, but the following is likely going to be part of it:

We'll listen to a variety of podcasts and analyze them. We'll listen to long-form podcasts similar to the ones I executive produced, but we'll also listen to everything from one-episode pods to pods that use humor to tell crime stories.

We'll talk about ethics, how we treat victims, how we tell good stories, the culture impact of the genre and much more.

There probably will be no textbook, but we will have readings (magazine think pieces, blog posts, etc) and a lot of things to listen to.

If you have questions, let me know. I expect to have 295 seats open for this course, though I have no idea how quickly it will fill.

1068,u8qnjx,"utaustin,articles,schedule,web,year,ut,new,class,courses,experience",1.5549024999999999,Some summer/fall registration protips," 

Dear  students, registration is well upon us! As someone who's receiving and  answer a lot of registration-related emails, I thought I would give you  (esp our younger students) a few protips to navigate the registration  process, and hopefully make it run a little smoother.

1. Please  always include your EID in correspondence to your advisors. A good  practice may be to create an email signature with your name, major,  class and EID. Not including your EID slows down advisors being able to  help answer your question.
2. This  is just the first registration period for Fall and Summer. You can find  the Registration periods in the course schedule and also on your RIS.  After next week, registration is closed until June. Then fall  registration will reopen in June for 7 weeks, which coincides with New  Student Orientation. There will still be time to make adjustments to  your schedules before classes start in August. After grades run,  students may be making adjustments to their fall schedules because of  prerequisites.  Also, for students who are offered internal transfer,  you'll have a chance to meet with an advisor after those decisions come  out for help making adjustments to your fall schedule.
3. If  a class is full, and if there's a waitlist, be sure to get on the  waitlist! You must be registered in at least one course before you'll be  given the option to get on a waitlist. Not all departments will offer  waitlists for courses.
4. A  couple of waitlist errors to avoid: make sure adding the waitlisted  course won't put you over 17 hours. If so and you don't have permission  to go over 17 hours, you'll get a promotion error and not be added to  the class. If you're adding a wait list for a different section of a  class you're in, add the class you're in as your swap course! I see a  ton of promotion errors for these two reasons.
5. Don't  assume that because a course says Restricted in the course schedule  that you aren't part of the restrictions. You may be. Try adding a  course first and if you can't add it, then you can explore further.
6. If  you have an issue of not being able to add a course because of  prerequisites, and you believe you should be able to, you will need to  contact the department offering the course. If you have a substitution  that is acceptable to that department, they may be able to offer you a  prerequisite waiver. If the course is outside your department, your  advisor will not be able to waive the prerequisite.
7. Be  sure to check your RIS for bars, and clear them before you register!  The only bar your advisor can clear is an advising bar. Everyone has to  sign the Statement of Financial Responsibility. Some of you may have  other bars. Your RIS will tell you all.
8. Have  back up plans for classes that have multiple sections. (This is  especially true for students who won't be registering until next week.) I  know it can be frustrating not to get the schedule you want, but  departments are trying very hard to make sure they have enough seats in  classes for all the students who need them.
9. After  you register, you can always run an IDA counting future registered  courses, to make sure classes are counting the way you expect them to.  This is particularly a good idea for students who are close to  graduation.
10. Advisors  are getting a lot of emails right now, plus meeting with students for  advising. Advisors may also be doing a number of other things like  course scheduling (those who do course scheduling are starting work as  of this week on the spring 23 course schedule), planning commencement,  verifying spring graduates, managing enrollments, planning for  orientation, and a number of other administrative duties. There may be a  delay in getting a reply to your email.

I  know there are many more questions that come up about registration, but  these are pretty much the top issues that I've been addressing the last  few weeks.

I also invite current/former AET students to voice their experiences in the comments. I'm a completely different person from the first u/aetwarning that was made[ 5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/5qsl4f/aet_warning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but I'm here to tell you it didn't get better, it got worse. Everything the original aetwarning account said remains true. As they said, the professors are mostly great people but most of the courses are lacking, and we find ourselves doing the learning ourselves in most cases. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Year after year admin have made changes to the program that no one asked for, without telling students, while gaslighting us saying these things have been in place since the beginning. I am going to tell the story of what AET students have gone through for the past year or so.

**Troubling Signs**  
Back when AET was first offered it was split into 3 different emphases: Game Dev, Music and Sound (M&S), and Projection, Lighting, and Interactivity (PLAI) (now known as Live Event Technologies). Around the year I enrolled (F2019), they added a 4th emphasis called Digital Visualization, which encompassed digital art and animation. These weren't strict tracks; you could take classes in any emphasis as you pleased. If you wayback machined to the AET website to around this time, you can still see how there were 4 emphases ([screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/ZZCAgn2)). The class entering in F2020 also chose to enroll in this program based on that information. However, without consulting any of the students, the [website changed](https://imgur.com/a/PIGnYN0) to reflect a more cross-disciplinary curriculum. Instead of being able to focus on your desired path, you were encouraged to engage in courses that were more or less irrelevant to most students. I've always liked how AET is open for students to take classes even in something that isn't their focus if they're interested, but not everyone is interested. I can see how most people wouldn't see this as that big of a deal, but a large group of students began to grow restless after the release of the Fall 2021 course schedule.

**Music and Sound Gets Shafted**  
Disregarding that they accidently posted the 2019 course schedule instead of the 2021 version at first, upon release M&S students noticed a severe lack of classes for them to take. Funnily enough, with the accidental posting of the 2019 schedule, there were actually classes M&S students were excited were finally being offered again, and then realized this was an old schedule. Several students had no other classes to take because they've already taken all the ones currently being offered, unless they started taking random game classes and what not. It really did seem like M&S was getting the short end of the stick here. Plus, a lot of things M&S students were hoping to learn, many of which were things led on by the old website (such as hands on audio engineering courses) were just straight up never offered and were never getting offered. Fed up, a few students started compiling a list of classes many M&S students wanted and sent them to **AET Chair Michael Baker**. It was also recently unveiled that the foundation courses within AET were getting merged with each other for some odd reason, and one such merge was putting the M&S foundations with the PLAI foundations, cutting both of the contents of the original courses in half. One night around this time, students began voicing their frustrations in the (at the time) official AET discord server.

**The AET Revolution Event**  
Hundreds of messages were sent voicing student concerns, wants and needs from not just M&S students, but others who also had issues with the program. This will come up later but Digital Viz students were also unhappy with their course work. None of us feel as if we have been taught enough to be anywhere near employable, especially in the games field (this is also due to an entire separate issue regarding game education that we'll get to later). A lot of our learning comes from YouTube rather than actual class. Sometimes the instructional material itself is a YouTube video!! While there were admin and professors in the server that were probably watching this go down, we didn't get any responses from them that night. However, the next night, Michael Baker himself started an out of the blue, impromptu AMA right there in the server, while being *very* passive aggressive about the whole thing, with quotes like:

“I have not read the entire discussion, but saw enough to see that the torches were out”  
“I've received multiple emails and dms in the last day which I would describe as charged, inaccurate, emotional, and unhelpful. Shouting at me will not help your situation.”  
“Contrary to the conspiracy theories offered here…”  
“Cmon people, y'all dropped like 1500 messages last night”

On top of these one liners, his answers to our many questions were... less than desired. Upon being asked what industries the M&S path was created to target, his response was “experience design, themed entertainment, architecture.” Notice how none of these were a part of the original website list of potential careers. It was twisted to get that response when this is not what was advertised before, and these industries have never been mentioned until this response. During this time, we also received information that leads us to believe that M&S was being phased out completely. I wish I could show you a recap of that night.. oh wait! I can! [Here](https://youtu.be/qjtdpAjMDno) you can find the AMA supercut made by a student! I hope it gives you a look at some of what we are dealing with, or at the very least mildly entertains you. **I really recommend you give it a watch.**

**The Lawsuit**  
This is sort of unrelated to everything I've mentioned, but there is a lawsuit currently being filed against AET/UT by a former professor. It's a lot to get into so I'm going to be making a separate post about it, but it includes Title IX stuff being hidden from students, and the suit itself is for wrongful termination after it was reported. Here is the [case history](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18727820/stamps-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/) and here is the [main complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1116588/gov.uscourts.txwd.1116588.1.0.pdf).

**Interactivity is the New Black**  
It's been a year since AET Revolution at this point and frankly, nothing has changed. Okay, that's a lie. Things have actually gotten worse! A significant portion of AET students are here because they wanted to hone their craft/work exclusively in what they're skilled in. M&S students want to make music and work with audio (even if we don't have the classes to help with that). Many Digital Viz students want to be concept artists, illustrators and/or animators. This is all great! However, over the past year AET has been really pushing the addition of ""interactivity"" to our work. This doesn't really affect game devs as interactivity is the name of the game (lol), but the students pursuing the above mentioned are getting shoved into that direction by force. For the past year we have experienced the great push into **interactive/experience design**. Remember that phrase. In a course packet for Fall 22 that was sent to us a couple weeks back, they listed sections in which classes were organized. In this list, there was 5th addition to the previously known ""emphases"" called Experience Design, defined as ""storytelling and interactive experience design for digital and physical spaces."" Okay... well what does that mean exactly?

Well, given that this is the first time being told about this new section of classes, we're not really sure either. But here's a few examples of classes being offered (or have been offered and would fit into this category): Next Gen Outdoor Play, Themed Entertainment Design, Storytelling with Mini Golf, Immersive Art Installations. If you've ever been to a Meow Wolf installation or know what it is (Omega Mart if anyone is familiar), it's a lot of stuff similar to that. Even Disney Imagineering type of stuff. Which is awesome! Crazy installations like these are amazing and I'm glad there's an avenue for students interested in that type of work. But that's the thing, current students of AET who came in for something completely different are not interested in this type of work. I would be completely okay with this existing as its own separate emphasis if they weren't forcing everyone besides game dev students (and even sometimes them too) down that path. And I can only assume that's the current end goal for AET is a major.

**The Removal of Independent Study**  
You may be wondering, how do we know AET is trying to push everyone in this direction? Well, let's look at the senior capstones every AET student must do in order to graduate. During your senior year, you have a few options on what type of capstone to take each semester (you need two, one each semester your senior year). One, you can take game capstone 2D and/or 3D, which is a CS offered course. A lot of students have their issues with this course for reasons I won't get into (plus it’s only games). Second, you have Senior Design Project (SDP). Basically, you get into groups of your choosing and do whatever you want (despite game capstone, a lot of game dev students choose this instead). Lastly, there's Independent Study, a capstone you need a professor to sponsor you for where you work on a personal project of your choosing. Now, I am unsure if this was the case before Fall 21 as well, but SDP requires that all projects are interactive in some way. That means no pure animations, comics, or album like projects are allowed, unless they somehow incorporated interactivity. I won't even get into the weird corporate stuff they made students do for the spring version of SDP that took up a lot of project time and forced projects to go down some weird path. That leaves us with Independent Study.

After hearing the woes of game capstone and SDP, many students have opted to apply for Independent Study with a professor just so they can do something that isn't interactive, like making that big animation project they've always wanted to do, or some type of album or even a comic. Things like this are better for their portfolio than anything the other two courses have to offer. With the push to interactivity, its like fitting a circular peg into a square hole. Sure it might fit in, but only if it's small enough, and it will still never be the perfect fit. Sure games need artists, animators and musicians. Interactive/experience design projects need them too. But subjecting them to being a small piece of a project where interactivity is the focus instead of giving them the choice to create a project that is solely what they're good at is damaging. Independent Study was a great way for students to build out their portfolio or even create demo reals that will help them get jobs. So how do you think it felt to all of the students wanting to take independent study, who have already submitted proposals to professors, to be informed that Independent Study, while still a course you can take, will no longer count towards your senior capstone credit? A week before registration no less? I can only assume this was done on purpose due to the amount of students wanting a non-interactive senior capstone, but who's to say. In replacement,[ 5 other SDP courses](https://imgur.com/a/Aw2W7dy) were added (in addition to the original) that suffer from the same problems. All require interactivity, and digital viz students especially are at a loss.

**Game Dev Education is Largely a Scam**  
Let's take a break from the interactivity debacle. Game dev students aren't winning either, ya know. Now, this is more a problem with the state of game education as a whole rather than just AET, but AET is still particularly awful at it. Much of the problems game dev students have here is the lack of advanced courses, and the feeling of dread when you realize that you are no where near employable or ready for the games industry. The majority of students are fine when random courses like storytelling with mini golf and other odd ball classes are offered, but only when the rest of the curriculum is already rounded out for the students who need them. Yes, it takes a lot of work outside of class too. But the amount of self learning we do is absurd, and there are countless things game dev students could be learning within the classroom itself. A lot of AET is telling students to make their own projects, whatever we want, but that doesn't help when that also means teach yourself how to do said project as well. If we don't have the necessary tools to make a project not only functional, but *good*, really what's the point? For all the interested game dev students out there, here are two really good twitter threads on why game dev education is largely a scam ([1](https://twitter.com/robbytaku/status/1512248842854486057?s=21) [2](https://twitter.com/JLHGameArt/status/1486770179157766149)). If you want to go to school for game dev, honestly, the program at Austin Community College is better than AET. Game Dev should be taught more as a vocation than at a 4 year university, nevermind one where game dev is one of 5 different ""emphases"". If you absolutely need to go to a 4 year, try ATEC at UTD. I know I just talked down on AET for being 5 different things that aren't just game dev, and ATEC is similar in that regard, but I believe ATEC is still leagues better than AET (although I hear it still has its problems, do your own research). Hell, ACC's program is game dev, animation and motion graphics, but looking at the classes offered and the professors they're taught by makes AET's game dev look like a high school track. Lastly, if you're interested in game programming, you're never gonna learn enough programming skills here, even with Elements of CS. You'd be better off as a CS major in pretty much any university.

**What Was it All For?**  
So, there you have it. Three years of watching this program deteriorate before my very eyes, after I had hoped so much that it would get better after reading aetwarning's post and many others. Three years of learning through YouTube videos, improving through twitter threads. Three years of watching my digital viz friends not getting to learn the digital arts skills they hoped they learn, and getting pushed towards interactivity in the end. Three years of watching my M&S friends get scammed into coming into AET expecting to learn one thing and getting jack in return. Three years of some of the worst communication between students and admin I've ever seen. Three years of seeing this major turn into corporate, interactive experience design, and three years of seeing the program change without any student input. As another student put it during the AET revolution, **there seems to be more change than growth.** Even RTF has some better animation courses, and even game dev courses that we aren't even allowed to take without the waitlist loophole. Please please please don’t blame the professors as I don’t believe that this is their fault. A lot of the shortcomings of professors and their classes are a result of the structure of this program and what they’re being asked of from admin. Not to mention, AET is the only major in UT where none of the professors are tenured, probably forcing many of them to not fight back at risk of their jobs (there have already been instances of professors being mysteriously let go). This program just feels like one be joke and we're the butt of it.

**And Finally, the TL;DR**  
I'd recommend reading the above paragraph as well. AET Chair Michael Baker wants to steer the major into more corporate, interactive experience design. Do not come here for animation or digital art that isn't for video games or interactive experiences. But also don't come here for video games either, as game education is a scam. Do not come here for Music and Sound, it’s being phased out. You WILL end up teaching yourself through YouTube. If interactive experience design sounds like your thing, go for it! But I'm tired of freshmen and transfer students being scammed into coming here year after year.

I also invite current/former AET students to voice their experiences in the comments. I'm a completely different person from the first u/aetwarning that was made[ 5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/5qsl4f/aet_warning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but I'm here to tell you it didn't get better, it got worse. Everything the original aetwarning account said remains true. As they said, the professors are mostly great people but most of the courses are lacking, and we find ourselves doing the learning ourselves in most cases. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Year after year admin have made changes to the program that no one asked for, without telling students, while gaslighting us saying these things have been in place since the beginning. I am going to tell the story of what AET students have gone through for the past year or so.

**Troubling Signs**  
Back when AET was first offered it was split into 3 different emphases: Game Dev, Music and Sound (M&S), and Projection, Lighting, and Interactivity (PLAI) (now known as Live Event Technologies). Around the year I enrolled (F2019), they added a 4th emphasis called Digital Visualization, which encompassed digital art and animation. These weren't strict tracks; you could take classes in any emphasis as you pleased. If you wayback machined to the AET website to around this time, you can still see how there were 4 emphases ([screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/ZZCAgn2)). The class entering in F2020 also chose to enroll in this program based on that information. However, without consulting any of the students, the [website changed](https://imgur.com/a/PIGnYN0) to reflect a more cross-disciplinary curriculum. Instead of being able to focus on your desired path, you were encouraged to engage in courses that were more or less irrelevant to most students. I've always liked how AET is open for students to take classes even in something that isn't their focus if they're interested, but not everyone is interested. I can see how most people wouldn't see this as that big of a deal, but a large group of students began to grow restless after the release of the Fall 2021 course schedule.

**Music and Sound Gets Shafted**  
Disregarding that they accidently posted the 2019 course schedule instead of the 2021 version at first, upon release M&S students noticed a severe lack of classes for them to take. Funnily enough, with the accidental posting of the 2019 schedule, there were actually classes M&S students were excited were finally being offered again, and then realized this was an old schedule. Several students had no other classes to take because they've already taken all the ones currently being offered, unless they started taking random game classes and what not. It really did seem like M&S was getting the short end of the stick here. Plus, a lot of things M&S students were hoping to learn, many of which were things led on by the old website (such as hands on audio engineering courses) were just straight up never offered and were never getting offered. Fed up, a few students started compiling a list of classes many M&S students wanted and sent them to **AET Chair Michael Baker**. It was also recently unveiled that the foundation courses within AET were getting merged with each other for some odd reason, and one such merge was putting the M&S foundations with the PLAI foundations, cutting both of the contents of the original courses in half. One night around this time, students began voicing their frustrations in the (at the time) official AET discord server.

**The AET Revolution Event**  
Hundreds of messages were sent voicing student concerns, wants and needs from not just M&S students, but others who also had issues with the program. This will come up later but Digital Viz students were also unhappy with their course work. None of us feel as if we have been taught enough to be anywhere near employable, especially in the games field (this is also due to an entire separate issue regarding game education that we'll get to later). A lot of our learning comes from YouTube rather than actual class. Sometimes the instructional material itself is a YouTube video!! While there were admin and professors in the server that were probably watching this go down, we didn't get any responses from them that night. However, the next night, Michael Baker himself started an out of the blue, impromptu AMA right there in the server, while being *very* passive aggressive about the whole thing, with quotes like:

“I have not read the entire discussion, but saw enough to see that the torches were out”  
“I've received multiple emails and dms in the last day which I would describe as charged, inaccurate, emotional, and unhelpful. Shouting at me will not help your situation.”  
“Contrary to the conspiracy theories offered here…”  
“Cmon people, y'all dropped like 1500 messages last night”

On top of these one liners, his answers to our many questions were... less than desired. Upon being asked what industries the M&S path was created to target, his response was “experience design, themed entertainment, architecture.” Notice how none of these were a part of the original website list of potential careers. It was twisted to get that response when this is not what was advertised before, and these industries have never been mentioned until this response. During this time, we also received information that leads us to believe that M&S was being phased out completely. I wish I could show you a recap of that night.. oh wait! I can! [Here](https://youtu.be/qjtdpAjMDno) you can find the AMA supercut made by a student! I hope it gives you a look at some of what we are dealing with, or at the very least mildly entertains you. **I really recommend you give it a watch.**

**The Lawsuit**  
This is sort of unrelated to everything I've mentioned, but there is a lawsuit currently being filed against AET/UT by a former professor. It's a lot to get into so I'm going to be making a separate post about it, but it includes Title IX stuff being hidden from students, and the suit itself is for wrongful termination after it was reported. Here is the [case history](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18727820/stamps-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/) and here is the [main complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1116588/gov.uscourts.txwd.1116588.1.0.pdf).

**Interactivity is the New Black**  
It's been a year since AET Revolution at this point and frankly, nothing has changed. Okay, that's a lie. Things have actually gotten worse! A significant portion of AET students are here because they wanted to hone their craft/work exclusively in what they're skilled in. M&S students want to make music and work with audio (even if we don't have the classes to help with that). Many Digital Viz students want to be concept artists, illustrators and/or animators. This is all great! However, over the past year AET has been really pushing the addition of ""interactivity"" to our work. This doesn't really affect game devs as interactivity is the name of the game (lol), but the students pursuing the above mentioned are getting shoved into that direction by force. For the past year we have experienced the great push into **interactive/experience design**. Remember that phrase. In a course packet for Fall 22 that was sent to us a couple weeks back, they listed sections in which classes were organized. In this list, there was 5th addition to the previously known ""emphases"" called Experience Design, defined as ""storytelling and interactive experience design for digital and physical spaces."" Okay... well what does that mean exactly?

Well, given that this is the first time being told about this new section of classes, we're not really sure either. But here's a few examples of classes being offered (or have been offered and would fit into this category): Next Gen Outdoor Play, Themed Entertainment Design, Storytelling with Mini Golf, Immersive Art Installations. If you've ever been to a Meow Wolf installation or know what it is (Omega Mart if anyone is familiar), it's a lot of stuff similar to that. Even Disney Imagineering type of stuff. Which is awesome! Crazy installations like these are amazing and I'm glad there's an avenue for students interested in that type of work. But that's the thing, current students of AET who came in for something completely different are not interested in this type of work. I would be completely okay with this existing as its own separate emphasis if they weren't forcing everyone besides game dev students (and even sometimes them too) down that path. And I can only assume that's the current end goal for AET is a major.

**The Removal of Independent Study**  
You may be wondering, how do we know AET is trying to push everyone in this direction? Well, let's look at the senior capstones every AET student must do in order to graduate. During your senior year, you have a few options on what type of capstone to take each semester (you need two, one each semester your senior year). One, you can take game capstone 2D and/or 3D, which is a CS offered course. A lot of students have their issues with this course for reasons I won't get into (plus it’s only games). Second, you have Senior Design Project (SDP). Basically, you get into groups of your choosing and do whatever you want (despite game capstone, a lot of game dev students choose this instead). Lastly, there's Independent Study, a capstone you need a professor to sponsor you for where you work on a personal project of your choosing. Now, I am unsure if this was the case before Fall 21 as well, but SDP requires that all projects are interactive in some way. That means no pure animations, comics, or album like projects are allowed, unless they somehow incorporated interactivity. I won't even get into the weird corporate stuff they made students do for the spring version of SDP that took up a lot of project time and forced projects to go down some weird path. That leaves us with Independent Study.

After hearing the woes of game capstone and SDP, many students have opted to apply for Independent Study with a professor just so they can do something that isn't interactive, like making that big animation project they've always wanted to do, or some type of album or even a comic. Things like this are better for their portfolio than anything the other two courses have to offer. With the push to interactivity, its like fitting a circular peg into a square hole. Sure it might fit in, but only if it's small enough, and it will still never be the perfect fit. Sure games need artists, animators and musicians. Interactive/experience design projects need them too. But subjecting them to being a small piece of a project where interactivity is the focus instead of giving them the choice to create a project that is solely what they're good at is damaging. Independent Study was a great way for students to build out their portfolio or even create demo reals that will help them get jobs. So how do you think it felt to all of the students wanting to take independent study, who have already submitted proposals to professors, to be informed that Independent Study, while still a course you can take, will no longer count towards your senior capstone credit? A week before registration no less? I can only assume this was done on purpose due to the amount of students wanting a non-interactive senior capstone, but who's to say. In replacement,[ 5 other SDP courses](https://imgur.com/a/Aw2W7dy) were added (in addition to the original) that suffer from the same problems. All require interactivity, and digital viz students especially are at a loss.

**Game Dev Education is Largely a Scam**  
Let's take a break from the interactivity debacle. Game dev students aren't winning either, ya know. Now, this is more a problem with the state of game education as a whole rather than just AET, but AET is still particularly awful at it. Much of the problems game dev students have here is the lack of advanced courses, and the feeling of dread when you realize that you are no where near employable or ready for the games industry. The majority of students are fine when random courses like storytelling with mini golf and other odd ball classes are offered, but only when the rest of the curriculum is already rounded out for the students who need them. Yes, it takes a lot of work outside of class too. But the amount of self learning we do is absurd, and there are countless things game dev students could be learning within the classroom itself. A lot of AET is telling students to make their own projects, whatever we want, but that doesn't help when that also means teach yourself how to do said project as well. If we don't have the necessary tools to make a project not only functional, but *good*, really what's the point? For all the interested game dev students out there, here are two really good twitter threads on why game dev education is largely a scam ([1](https://twitter.com/robbytaku/status/1512248842854486057?s=21) [2](https://twitter.com/JLHGameArt/status/1486770179157766149)). If you want to go to school for game dev, honestly, the program at Austin Community College is better than AET. Game Dev should be taught more as a vocation than at a 4 year university, nevermind one where game dev is one of 5 different ""emphases"". If you absolutely need to go to a 4 year, try ATEC at UTD. I know I just talked down on AET for being 5 different things that aren't just game dev, and ATEC is similar in that regard, but I believe ATEC is still leagues better than AET (although I hear it still has its problems, do your own research). Hell, ACC's program is game dev, animation and motion graphics, but looking at the classes offered and the professors they're taught by makes AET's game dev look like a high school track. Lastly, if you're interested in game programming, you're never gonna learn enough programming skills here, even with Elements of CS. You'd be better off as a CS major in pretty much any university.

**What Was it All For?**  
So, there you have it. Three years of watching this program deteriorate before my very eyes, after I had hoped so much that it would get better after reading aetwarning's post and many others. Three years of learning through YouTube videos, improving through twitter threads. Three years of watching my digital viz friends not getting to learn the digital arts skills they hoped they learn, and getting pushed towards interactivity in the end. Three years of watching my M&S friends get scammed into coming into AET expecting to learn one thing and getting jack in return. Three years of some of the worst communication between students and admin I've ever seen. Three years of seeing this major turn into corporate, interactive experience design, and three years of seeing the program change without any student input.

**And Finally, the TL;DR**

It was some middle-aged white dude with some goatee-type beard thing goin on; he claimed that he worked for some studio audio installment company and had some leftover surround-sound speakers that his manager had asked him to get rid of. Now first off I normally wouldn't fall for shit like this, but what sold me was the packaging. It looked so.. real. The speaker was called the PSW S6 soundbar from this company called PSW Cinema. He claimed it has an MSRP of $880 and showed me the website; upon a brief glance, it looked pretty legit. I offered to pay $200 since I was kind of in the market for a speaker anyway, and he just agreed. Should've noticed the sus when he didn't even negotiate for such a big mark down, but whatever.

I come home to my apartment and realize that the speaker only even exists for resale on eBay, and the company website looks too ambiguous to be legit. None of the certifications for the speaker on the packaging are real, and I sit dumbfucked at my dining table after researching for 10 minutes and realizing that this is part of a huge scandal. Literally multiple Reddit posts describe this exact scenario, with college students and others being sold fake or off-brand speakers from car sellers with the EXACT same schpiel from the sellers. There goes $200, I guess. I ended up using Venmo to make the payment to an account that I don't even know is real (if it's not then I guess that works out for me), and both UTPD and APD are either too busy or not helpful for this kind of issue.

TLDR I got scammed in west campus by a guy in a truck into buying a worthless soundbar. Don't fall for it, his schpiel is convincing but if you just do a bit of Googling on the products, youll see through it all.

Now that exams are over, I wanted to shamelessly plug a class I’m teaching this summer – Summer Intensive Ancient Greek.

Summer Intensive Ancient Greek (GK w804 & GK w412) is a 10-week course that gets you 12 credit-hours / 2 semesters of language credit; for most of you, that’s your entire language requirement, completed in two and a half months. And if you’re interested in pursuing Ancient Greek further, you could potentially end up jumping all the way to advanced (5th semester) Greek classes as soon as this coming Fall!

I’ll add a disclaimer here, though: this class is a fair bit of work and a significant time commitment, so if either of those are deal-breakers, then feel free to stop here.

That’s the basics. If I’ve piqued your interest, here’s a bit more detail:

* In this class we teach with a pretty unique, simplified linguistic approach (morphophonological analysis) that helps you understand how language (Greek as well as others) actually works, rather than just memorizing dozens of charts like you would in a traditional Greek class. This means that you will be reading unadapted, 2500-year-old texts by the twelfth day of class! By the end of the course, you will have read Plato’s entire Apology, a whole tragedy by Euripides, and a whole book of Homer’s Odyssey, as well as scattered selections from a number of other authors, all in their original language.

* We are in class from 8:30-11 and 12-2:30 every day for 10 weeks. It’s a lot of time. And it’s pretty rigid, so things like jobs or other courses are not really feasible. But, as I mentioned above, this is getting you the equivalent of an entire year of language credit, and your Greek could easily be at a third- or fourth-semester level after only 10 weeks. It’s not for everyone, but the rewards are significant.

Anyways, that’s what I’ve got for you. If you’ve got any more questions, I’m more than happy to answer them here!",ut62dk,52,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/ut62dk/unique_summer_language_class_intensive_ancient/,"Unique summer language class - Intensive Ancient Greek Hello UT people,

My friend’s son just wrapped freshman year.  Physics major.  Out of state.  Good friend network.  Frat. Intramural sports, fairly regular at the gym, even a first girlfriend.  What’s the problem?  Substance problem \[weed everyday\], barely attended classes, didn’t do the work, dropped a critical class in his major, and has the crummy grades to show for it.  And it’s getting worse.  When confronted, the son displays steely resolve not to let this happen again, but that feels like fairy dust.  This seems to be the classic UT dilemma - nobody cares if you fail.  But I know there must be some meaningful resources to support students - advisors, counseling, coaches - some I see online, but curious for experiences/recommendations – both official / and those not so obvious that might give him a chance to get back on track.  Any thoughts/advice much appreciated.

**Chapter 1: Prologue**

**>Hello, World!**

Hi everyone, I figured if you were gonna spend ample time reading this document then maybe you should know a little bit about me and my situation (by the way I’d like to stay somewhat anonymous for now just so I don't give future AET professors/higher ups a reason to dislike me). I will be attending UT this coming semester, fall 2022, and maybe some of you are wondering why someone who hasn't even spent a single second in a college classroom would be writing about the trials and tribulations of a small COFA major, and this section of the document is meant to answer some of your questions regarding myself and the purpose of this project. I was originally accepted into UT’s design program, but after attending a small tour of the design facilities and learning more about this major, it seemed like it wasn't for me. I appealed my major to AET because I thought it sounded like it was a better fit for me. Eventually I came to regret this decision after reading a reddit post detailing the shortcomings of AET. After reading said reddit post, I began my quest to research more about this topic, and to my dismay, there wasn't a ton of information out there, and the only anecdotal info regarding this major seemed to be largely negative. I began messaging people on discord via the official AET server as well as other small ones. After having an extremely insightful and long conversation with an alumni about his success out of AET, I decided that I wanted more responses. I created a Google form for both AET students and alumni with the intention to give the public more information about the student opinions of this major, as well as the outcomes of someone who graduates with an AET degree. The data gathered from this form is already impacting the major, as it is currently being used to improve AET 304, a foundation class. So for that I thank everyone, sincerely, for participating in this form, it wouldn't be possible without you. I hope that this project helps anyone who is interested in AET. Without wasting anymore time, let's get into it.

**The Whistleblower**

Arts and Entertainment Technologies was introduced to the University of Texas at Austin in the Fall of 2016, which was a major that was targeted towards creatives that were interested in topics like animation, video game design, and music production. On January 29th, 2017, Reddit user “Aetwarning” was created, which warned those who were thinking of internally transferring into AET. Aetwarning’s post describes their grievances with the major, which includes courses lacking substance and purpose, and the professors lacking professional work. This reddit user states that many students were planning on transferring out or had already. It has been 5 years since this was posted on reddit, and since then, user Aetwarning has gone silent.

**“These Days You Gotta Have A Sequel”**

On April 3rd, 2022, Reddit user “AETWarning2” was created, roughly 6 years after AET was introduced to the university. This user claims to have no affiliation with the original Aetwarning, and posted the following on the r/UTAustin subreddit titled: “AET Has Not Gotten Better and it is Not Going to Improve: The Suffering of the AET Student Body”. The focal point of this post was how AET was going in a direction that most students did not approve of. Some key points include AET becoming more of a “T” shaped major, the lack of Music and Sound courses, a dysfunctional AMA in the official AET discord, the push into interactivity, the removal of independent study, and the lack of quality that these classes provided. If you haven't read this post, I highly recommend it as it provides more context to this issue and I think it's necessary you do so if you are to continue to read this document, [here is the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/udh966/aet_has_not_gotten_better_and_it_is_not_going_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This post exploded amongst the AET community, and was fairly popular on r/UTAustin for a few days. This post especially concerned those in the class of 2026 due to most of them already being enrolled at UT.

**Chapter 2: Eureka! Data.**

**Google Form Quick Stats**

In total the sample pool consisted of 54 student responses and 22 Alumni responses, and although I am glad I was able to get a sufficient amount of student feedback, I fear that the lack of Alumni responses will affect the results of this data which might be one limitation that these results have.

**Chapter 3: The Court of Public Opinion (Part 1)**

**The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly**

The court of public opinion is now in session and it's time to compile all of these responses in a way as to where you can draw your own conclusions (we will get to my personal opinion later on). Personally I feel like we should address the negative responses first in order to get them out of the way. The main problems that AET has derives from two factors, its academics and its management.

The academics at AET aren’t held to the same standard as other majors at UT. A lot of students say that this major involves an extensive amount of self teaching (Youtube is going to be your best friend here). Another problem is the level of academic rigor that these classes provide. Students mention that some of these classes feel like they could be electives in highschool, and don't provide enough substance or quality to be good enough for college courses. Examples of this include a lack of things like basic narrative design, exploring other game engines other than Unity, and having multiple layers of progression in available tracks (Animation I, Animation II, etc). The lack of academic rigor is unfortunately reflected in the projects that come from this major as well (AET Senior Design Projects). There are a lot of examples of less prestigious universities producing a video game design student body that is far more skilled and equipped to enter the game industry compared to UT’s. Some examples of this include institutions like Clark University, RIT, Michigan State University, and UT Dallas. Let's take our emphasis away from the game design portion of AET for a bit. All of these problems are present in every available track, although game design seems to have the least amount of problems. The rest of the tracks like PLAI, Music and Sound, and digital visualization have all the same problems game design has but much worse. The classes that you can take in these tracks are few and far between, and when you are able to find a course it ends up being extremely surface level, which is especially true for the music and sound track. These are some quotes gathered from students and alumni that describe their negative opinions towards AET: “The AET curriculum is poorly structured and lacks rigor. Too many foundation classes and not enough advanced classes. For example, there’s an Intro to Animation but no Animation II or III. There’s a game scripting I but no II. It feels like anyone going in could become a jack of all trades but that’s not what the industry wants. It feels like you can’t have a specific specialization, just a general specialization in game design or something.” “A lot of good professors and a few really great classes, but the program was pretty heavily in flux so every semester was different and a lot of classes don't necessarily feel like great ways to advance your portfolio.”

Some say that the biggest problem that AET has is the management of the major. Overall, AET seems to be very disorganized and inconsistent. Some classes may appear one semester then be scrapped the next, which makes it really hard for students to be able to figure out their degree plan. The higher ups at AET seem to be pushing interactivity into every aspect of AET, and while that is fine for some students, others do not want to be forced down this track. A lot of students mention that they should just cut out certain aspects of the major, like themed entertainment design, or at the very least not force people to take classes that they have no interest in. Even though AET historically has focused on game design, it is shifting more and more towards focusing on interactivity and themed entertainment design, which none of the students asked for and most are not interested in these topics, as they did not apply to this major to get a degree focusing on how to design a theme park. This major seems to not allow students to specialize in their own field, which sets them up for hardships in the future as the entertainment industry is extremely competitive, which wants the best of the best for a desired position. A good analogy would be to see yourself as a tool for entertainment companies. If a company wants to hire an excellent “hammer”, they're not going to hire a mediocre hammer who can also be a mediocre wrench, they are going  to hire someone who specializes in being a hammer. AET students mention that their concerns do not feel heard whenever they bring it up with administrators, which is unfortunate because this major cannot improve when concerns fall on deaf ears. All of these problems combined have given AET a bad reputation, which reflects on all of the students of this major. AET’s reputation is known by a surprising number of non-AET students considering how small this major is, and AET’s reputation may also be known by local companies as well. Now, AET isn't all bad, there is still hope for this major, and a lot of students have described good aspects that AET possesses.

The list of good attributes of AET might not be as long as the former, but it is definitely worth looking into. When asked what students liked the most about AET, the vast majority of people mentioned the student body and the professors. It is considerably easier to “find your people” in this major compared to others. Almost every student here is extremely passionate about what they are doing, be that animation, game design, or music. There is a large sense of comradery in this major, which some may appreciate. Most of the professors are nice and genuinely want to help students achieve their goals (seems like a lot of students love Neal Daughtery so shout out to you if you're reading this).  Some students mention that this major is pretty easy compared to most at UT, so you may have an easier time here compared to other students. While these classes may indeed be very easy, something that might factor into this opinion is that a vast majority of students already have previous experience in things like music, art, or coding. The networking opportunities that AET provides is also one aspect that students appreciate, especially with companies like EA and Blizzard being in Austin. Here are some quotes gathered from students and alumni that describe their positive opinions towards AET: “I came to UT thinking it was a Game Design major that focused on all the different specializations of games. Therefore, I'm decently happy with what I've learned and I can say that (while this may be controversial), I really like some of the professors and feel they are genuinely invested in my learning. And that's one of the most important factors for me. If I can go to someone when I need help or have questions and they actually care and take time to give answers or make connections, I really appreciate that.” “It’s a great crossroad between art & design and comp-sci but still has some kinks that need to be worked out.”

**Attention Freshmen!**

When I ran this form I mainly had freshmen and prospective students in mind, so a lot of these form questions are geared towards this audience. During this section of the document, we will be discussing advice AET students have for freshmen.

When AET students were asked what they would have done differently their freshman year, this is what they had to say. A good chunk of students mentioned that they would have tried to transfer out of AET. The majority mentioned RTF, as it is better for animation and music compared to AET. Others mentioned that they would have tried to transfer to CNS, ECE, CS or design. Others mentioned that they would have transferred to another university completely. Some mentioned more personal things, like to not procrastinate as much, work harder, join more clubs or orgs, make more friends, network and to focus on what they were good at. Speaking of networking, students gave some solid advice on this topic. Many said to create a LinkedIn, as it is the main way that connections were made. It is essential to get out of your comfort zone and attend anything and everything that is related to your career interests. This means to try to join as many clubs and organizations that you can, and to go to career oriented events as well. Make sure to be very sociable and make some friends as well!

I believe most people entering COFA are worried about getting jobs in the industry, and AET is not any different. I was able to gather great advice from people regarding how to acquire internships or jobs. First and foremost, networking and finding connections is vital to land certain jobs, so please try your best and put yourself out there. A good portfolio is also extremely helpful, and it is best to work as soon as possible on this portfolio, due to the competitive nature of entertainment industries. When completing AET assignments, make sure to make them as good as possible in order for them to look good on your portfolio. It is also extremely important for you to start looking into internships early, as soon as your first semester in college honestly. And lastly, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF! I know it might sound corny but even if you don't think you are good enough for a job/internships, submit your portfolio or application, because you never know.

**Chapter 3: The Court of Public Opinion (Part 2)**

**The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly, Alumni Edition!**

The court of public opinion is now calling up alumni up to the stand, where it is now their turn to discuss their experience on AET as a major. We will be discussing topics like alumni income, job prospects, advice, and we’ll see how Alumni answered their questions compared to current AET students.

**“Hello, I Like Money :D”**

As college students, projected income is something that we often think about. The whole point of college is to further your education in a subject that you enjoy, and to improve your job prospects regarding your intended career. As you could tell from the quick stats, AET alumni are definitely not struggling with their finances. According to my form, you are projected to make around $58.5k which is definitely very impressive considering that the average COFA student makes around $30k. It is even more impressive when you consider that the median income in Austin is $41k, and to live “comfortably” you would need to earn a minimum of $55k. You may be thinking, “those that are the high earners don't even have careers related to AET”, but I am here to prove you wrong. 65% of those that declared their salary mentioned that they were working in industries related to what AET covers. Some examples include: A Motion Graphics Animator (VR+AR) who earns $70k, someone in an undisclosed AET related job earning $92k, and another earning $57k. All of these are extremely respectable salaries, especially for COFA alumni. The highest paying jobs are in those that went into the tech industry, with respondents earning close to $100k and one in particular is currently earning $200k which is astonishing. Now that we know how much AET graduates make, we can get into how long it takes to get a job out of college. Some were able to get a job before they even graduated, but that was relatively rare. You can expect your job search to last around 3 months until you're able to land one, which isn't bad at all, the average college graduate typically finds work 3-6 months after graduation. There have been a few notable outliers when considering success, with one Alumni working at Industrial Light and Magic and another working for Disney, so working at a really famous studio like these is definitely possible.

**Passing the Torch**

It's best to learn from the experiences of others rather than going in blind into a vastly different environment that is college. A lot of the advice that alumni were able to provide was similar to advice that current students were able to give, although of course there are differences, and their responses have the luxury of having hindsight.

Some alumni mentioned if they were to do something different in their undergraduate years, is to not worry about the future as much. Anxiety can always get the best of us, and at times, it can get the better of us and drain us mentally. It is important to just believe in yourself and in your abilities, while always making progress towards your goals no matter what. Some wish that they would have taken more VR/AR classes, or be more aggressive with recruiters in showing off their work. When asked what tips they would give freshman for getting internships or jobs in AET related industries, they mentioned that its important to reach out to people and be social. For this question you can just refer to what students said, because their advice is very similar to what alumni said.

Ok coding nerds this one's for you so listen up. A decent chunk of AET alumni are now working in the tech space, and they have some advice for those that are wanting to get into the tech industry. It is really important to practice coding interview questions, because in a lot of software jobs they test your coding abilities during the interview. Alumni recommend practicing maybe 3-5 days a week. Make sure to have personal coding projects, it is also beneficial if you have a group coding project that you've worked on. Make sure to always be up to date on the latest coding languages and technology. Make sure to also attend many coding events like hackathons. Alumni mentioned that worrying about getting a degree in CS is useless, because you can get into the tech space with the certificate alone. Although your chances of working at a FAANG company are pretty low if you don't get a CS degree, if you graduate with the certificate plus your own personal projects, you can find a CS related job with relative ease, and with a decent chunk of change as well (AET alumni in the tech industry report a $60k-$200k salary).

For those interested in the first word in AET, here is some advice for you. Make sure your portfolio is STRONG. You are competing against hundreds of artists for the position that you want, be that an animator or being a concept artist. Make sure that your portfolio is unique and stands out from the rest. Reach out to everyone and everything. Reach out to fellow artists, in real life or social media, and most importantly, reach out to every art company, design firm, animation studio that you can. Take some classes out of AET, which can include studio art or design, or even RTF for better film structure and storyboard skills. If you want to go into tech art like VR/AR stuff, make sure you also take the CS certificate. Make sure to be able to match other art styles if you can, because that is a very valued skill in the animation industry for example. Make sure to get critique on your art (you wont find this in AET). There are many groups on discord that you can use in order to find critique. Talk to professors, practice effectively, if you can 5 days a week, learn industry software in and out, and put yourself out there, social media can be a powerful tool.

Some bad news for the music kids, there wasn't a lot of advice for people that were in the music industry. There was only one response which said to be very adaptable and to have a broad taste in music, as this will give you a better chance of success.

**Chapter 4: Coda**

**For the People, by the People**

Going forward with this document, I will be sharing my own opinion, which I believe is fair since I've been pretty objective so far. It is honestly abnormal for a prestigious university like UT to have a college program that has this amount of complaints/concerns. The fact that I even have to write this whole thing proves it so. If any faculty or administrator tells you that AET is an excellent and normal major, they are lying to you. Faculty and those that manage AET, if you are reading this, please listen to students when they have concerns, and please take this document/project seriously. Going to college is meant to enrich a student's education and improve their chances of doing what they want in life. This portion of the document is meant to detail what steps AET can take in order to improve as a major, and this is what students had to say. Transparency is something that I believe is necessary when managing a major, and most students agree with this sentiment. Addressing the direction AET is taking in a public manner is a good step in the right direction. Students also want foundation classes to improve, which thanks to data gathered from this form, is something that is currently happening as we speak. If AET insists on offering multiple fields like game dev, digital visualization, and music production, it should have more classes in these individual fields to allow students to specialize their skills. This will require more faculty of course, which hopefully is something that can happen in the future. Please tenure the professors, it would be extremely beneficial not only for the sake of the professors, but also for the students because doing so would allow professors  to more freely suggest changes for AET without the fear of being let go. This major needs to fix how it is advertised as many believed that they could advance their music skills in AET due to the mention of the music and audio track, but that isn't the case once you get here. Students often mention that AET should stick to these three tracks and kill off other ones (Interactivity and themed entertainment), the major is already spread thin if you ask me. If it were up to me, I would make AET music and sound a subdivision of RTF, due to them having more resources for music production and it would benefit both music students and AET students. I would remove the rest of the other tracks like themed entertainment and PLAI, since they seem unpopular and resources would be better spent developing the game design and animation aspect of AET, since the groundwork for those tracks are already there. And lastly I would advertise this major as a game design and animation program and nothing else. But this is just my opinion on how I would run things based on what Alumni and students have mentioned.

**Who Is This Major For?**

The following is my own personal opinion and is in the perspective of those who are yet to apply to UT. Would I recommend this major to the general population of students? No. I would only recommend this major to someone with the following traits. I would recommend this major to someone that already has extensive experience in game development/coding and art, and wants to be in the gaming industry, but accepts the possibility that they won't end up in game dev or the entertainment industry in the future. If you are to take this major, a certificate in another study is basically necessary. Furthermore, I would only recommend this major to someone who is dead set on living in Austin, and that also considers UT as one of their top schools. Someone who is easily self motivated and passionate about what they do would also do great in this major. In order to take advantage of this major, you must be a relatively social person and be able to put yourself out there whenever you can. If you check all of these boxes then great! I am sure that you will be able to experience success and relative satisfaction with this major. However, If you KNOW you want to be in game development I would not recommend AET, as you would be better off in UT CS or in another university all together like the ones previously mentioned. If you KNOW you want to be in the animation/concept art industry, I cannot recommend going to UT, and I would go to another university either specializing in the arts or I would go to universities that have highly ranked art and animation programs like NYU, NEU, Syracuse University, DigiPen etc. I am sorry to say but if you want to go into AET for music, please don't, and look into the butler school of music, RTF or another university altogether.

The topic of internal transfers always seems to be brought up when talking about AET, and unfortunately, UT Austin is probably one of the worst schools you could go to if you plan on internally transferring. The process of doing so is by far one of the most difficult ones across universities in the same league as UT. If you are already enrolled at UT, and you decide that AET is not for you, and can't transfer to another university, there are still some options for you. If you are going down the game dev track, you can *try* transferring into CS (30-50% successful transfer rate with a 4.0 GPA) or into Electrical and Computer Engineering which is slightly easier to transfer into, but still extremely difficult (if you want to have a chance it's best you have at least a 3.9 GPA). For those that are in AET wanting to focus on 2d animation and film, I recommend internally transferring into RTF, as it is a much more established program for these topics. It’s not going to be easy but it's definitely not as difficult as transferring into STEM. If  you want to focus on concept art, try transferring into studio art, it shouldn't be too hard since it's in the same college as AET. And finally for those in the music track, I recommend transferring into the butler school of music and perhaps RTF.

If you decide to stay in AET, please take advantage of all the advice that has been provided to you and apply it to yourself. Obviously I don't know you, but if you are able to follow all of this advice effectively, I am confident that you will succeed after graduating from UT.

**Final Thoughts**

Happiness. Satisfaction, and fulfillment. These are words that we would like to associate with our future after college. These are also words that I would like to discuss with you regarding AET. If you are an AET major, I do believe that your worries and concerns are justified, but to have anxiety riddle your mind regarding your future is something that is unnecessary and not helpful at all. Is AET a good major? To be blunt, No. No major that is considered “good” will have this amount of concerns and disappointed students. But Is AET a bad major? No, it isn't either. Is it decent? Yes, but some may consider AET to be disappointing considering the fact that [Austin Community College](https://www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs/areas-of-study/arts-digital-media-and-communications/game-development-animation-and-motion-graphics) has a better game dev, animation, and motion graphics program. The only aspects of AET that are better than the program at ACC is that AET has better access to resources, connections, and being in AET means you are a UT student, which is very valuable. In terms of educational content, it is unacceptable that a program like AET is being beat out by a similar program at a local community college, and honestly it is embarrassing on the behalf of the management team of AET.. If you are an incoming AET freshman, I recommend thinking about internally transferring to the majors that have been mentioned previously. I'm in no way telling you to transfer but thinking about it in my eyes is necessary if you are to go on with UT. However keep in mind that if you aren’t able to successfully transfer, it isn't the end of the world by any means. Students in the School of Design and Creative Technologies are the highest earners among COFA alumni. Using data from the [Austin Chamber of Commerce](https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/07-10-2018-graduate-earnings) and cross referencing it with my own data, I can conclude that AET in particular beats out the following bachelor majors in terms of projected annual earnings: Fine and Studio Arts, Psychology, Anthropology, Nutritional Sciences, RTF, Biology, Social Work, Human Development and Family Sciences, and English Language. So for being as mediocre as AET is, the student body there is able to provide extremely surprising results. Although I would be more confident in giving this credit to the students and not AET, since the student body seems extremely passionate and also goes into tech related industries with the aid of the CS-certificate, which honestly makes up for a lot of AET’s shortcomings. So with all of that being said, I would like to disclose my own plan of action. Personally, I think I’ll try internally transferring once into either CS, ECE, or RTF. If I don’t succeed, and remain in AET, I am happy with completing my college journey here at UT. I will major in AET with the addition of the CS certificate. I feel confident in my future no matter if I internally transfer or not, and I hope you feel like that as well after reading everything..

If you have any further questions, feel free to message me. I urge people to to have an open conversation about this topic. If you disagree with this document or agree, make it known. If any AET faculty is reading this, feel free to message me, as I am open to conversation. If anyone from the AET management team is reading this, please listen to students and make changes accordingly, we have waited long enough.

**TL;DR**

AET is not as terrible as its made out to be. AET is a mediocre major, with smart and creative people that end up earning more than most non-STEM majors and a few STEM majors. If you enjoy game design but are open to not using your major all that much for your future career, and would rather rely on UT-exclusive connections and certificates, then this major should suffice. Although I would not recommend this major to most people.

EDIT: It has come to my attention that even if you choose to pursue the Computer Science certificate, completion is not guaranteed because a lot of these classes get filled up extremely quickly. This makes this degree even harder to recommend.

**Chapter 1: Prologue**

**>Hello, World!**

Hi everyone, I figured if you were gonna spend ample time reading this document then maybe you should know a little bit about me and my situation (by the way I’d like to stay somewhat anonymous for now just so I don't give future AET professors/higher ups a reason to dislike me). I will be attending UT this coming semester, fall 2022, and maybe some of you are wondering why someone who hasn't even spent a single second in a college classroom would be writing about the trials and tribulations of a small COFA major, and this section of the document is meant to answer some of your questions regarding myself and the purpose of this project. I was originally accepted into UT’s design program, but after attending a small tour of the design facilities and learning more about this major, it seemed like it wasn't for me. I appealed my major to AET because I thought it sounded like it was a better fit for me. Eventually I came to regret this decision after reading a reddit post detailing the shortcomings of AET. After reading said reddit post, I began my quest to research more about this topic, and to my dismay, there wasn't a ton of information out there, and the only anecdotal info regarding this major seemed to be largely negative. I began messaging people on discord via the official AET server as well as other small ones. After having an extremely insightful and long conversation with an alumni about his success out of AET, I decided that I wanted more responses. I created a Google form for both AET students and alumni with the intention to give the public more information about the student opinions of this major, as well as the outcomes of someone who graduates with an AET degree. The data gathered from this form is already impacting the major, as it is currently being used to improve AET 304, a foundation class. So for that I thank everyone, sincerely, for participating in this form, it wouldn't be possible without you. I hope that this project helps anyone who is interested in AET. Without wasting anymore time, let's get into it.

**The Whistleblower**

Arts and Entertainment Technologies was introduced to the University of Texas at Austin in the Fall of 2016, which was a major that was targeted towards creatives that were interested in topics like animation, video game design, and music production. On January 29th, 2017, Reddit user “Aetwarning” was created, which warned those who were thinking of internally transferring into AET. Aetwarning’s post describes their grievances with the major, which includes courses lacking substance and purpose, and the professors lacking professional work. This reddit user states that many students were planning on transferring out or had already. It has been 5 years since this was posted on reddit, and since then, user Aetwarning has gone silent.

**“These Days You Gotta Have A Sequel”**

On April 3rd, 2022, Reddit user “AETWarning2” was created, roughly 6 years after AET was introduced to the university. This user claims to have no affiliation with the original Aetwarning, and posted the following on the r/UTAustin subreddit titled: “AET Has Not Gotten Better and it is Not Going to Improve: The Suffering of the AET Student Body”. The focal point of this post was how AET was going in a direction that most students did not approve of. Some key points include AET becoming more of a “T” shaped major, the lack of Music and Sound courses, a dysfunctional AMA in the official AET discord, the push into interactivity, the removal of independent study, and the lack of quality that these classes provided. If you haven't read this post, I highly recommend it as it provides more context to this issue and I think it's necessary you do so if you are to continue to read this document, [here is the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/udh966/aet_has_not_gotten_better_and_it_is_not_going_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This post exploded amongst the AET community, and was fairly popular on r/UTAustin for a few days. This post especially concerned those in the class of 2026 due to most of them already being enrolled at UT.

**Chapter 2: Eureka! Data.**

**Google Form Quick Stats**

In total the sample pool consisted of 54 student responses and 22 Alumni responses, and although I am glad I was able to get a sufficient amount of student feedback, I fear that the lack of Alumni responses will affect the results of this data which might be one limitation that these results have.

**Chapter 3: The Court of Public Opinion (Part 1)**

**The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly**

The court of public opinion is now in session and it's time to compile all of these responses in a way as to where you can draw your own conclusions (we will get to my personal opinion later on). Personally I feel like we should address the negative responses first in order to get them out of the way. The main problems that AET has derives from two factors, its academics and its management.

The academics at AET aren’t held to the same standard as other majors at UT. A lot of students say that this major involves an extensive amount of self teaching (Youtube is going to be your best friend here). Another problem is the level of academic rigor that these classes provide. Students mention that some of these classes feel like they could be electives in highschool, and don't provide enough substance or quality to be good enough for college courses. Examples of this include a lack of things like basic narrative design, exploring other game engines other than Unity, and having multiple layers of progression in available tracks (Animation I, Animation II, etc). The lack of academic rigor is unfortunately reflected in the projects that come from this major as well (AET Senior Design Projects). There are a lot of examples of less prestigious universities producing a video game design student body that is far more skilled and equipped to enter the game industry compared to UT’s. Some examples of this include institutions like Clark University, RIT, Michigan State University, and UT Dallas. Let's take our emphasis away from the game design portion of AET for a bit. All of these problems are present in every available track, although game design seems to have the least amount of problems. The rest of the tracks like PLAI, Music and Sound, and digital visualization have all the same problems game design has but much worse. The classes that you can take in these tracks are few and far between, and when you are able to find a course it ends up being extremely surface level, which is especially true for the music and sound track. These are some quotes gathered from students and alumni that describe their negative opinions towards AET: “The AET curriculum is poorly structured and lacks rigor. Too many foundation classes and not enough advanced classes. For example, there’s an Intro to Animation but no Animation II or III. There’s a game scripting I but no II. It feels like anyone going in could become a jack of all trades but that’s not what the industry wants. It feels like you can’t have a specific specialization, just a general specialization in game design or something.” “A lot of good professors and a few really great classes, but the program was pretty heavily in flux so every semester was different and a lot of classes don't necessarily feel like great ways to advance your portfolio.”

Some say that the biggest problem that AET has is the management of the major. Overall, AET seems to be very disorganized and inconsistent. Some classes may appear one semester then be scrapped the next, which makes it really hard for students to be able to figure out their degree plan. The higher ups at AET seem to be pushing interactivity into every aspect of AET, and while that is fine for some students, others do not want to be forced down this track. A lot of students mention that they should just cut out certain aspects of the major, like themed entertainment design, or at the very least not force people to take classes that they have no interest in. Even though AET historically has focused on game design, it is shifting more and more towards focusing on interactivity and themed entertainment design, which none of the students asked for and most are not interested in these topics, as they did not apply to this major to get a degree focusing on how to design a theme park. This major seems to not allow students to specialize in their own field, which sets them up for hardships in the future as the entertainment industry is extremely competitive, which wants the best of the best for a desired position. A good analogy would be to see yourself as a tool for entertainment companies. If a company wants to hire an excellent “hammer”, they're not going to hire a mediocre hammer who can also be a mediocre wrench, they are going  to hire someone who specializes in being a hammer. AET students mention that their concerns do not feel heard whenever they bring it up with administrators, which is unfortunate because this major cannot improve when concerns fall on deaf ears. All of these problems combined have given AET a bad reputation, which reflects on all of the students of this major. AET’s reputation is known by a surprising number of non-AET students considering how small this major is, and AET’s reputation may also be known by local companies as well. Now, AET isn't all bad, there is still hope for this major, and a lot of students have described good aspects that AET possesses.

The list of good attributes of AET might not be as long as the former, but it is definitely worth looking into. When asked what students liked the most about AET, the vast majority of people mentioned the student body and the professors. It is considerably easier to “find your people” in this major compared to others. Almost every student here is extremely passionate about what they are doing, be that animation, game design, or music. There is a large sense of comradery in this major, which some may appreciate. Most of the professors are nice and genuinely want to help students achieve their goals (seems like a lot of students love Neal Daughtery so shout out to you if you're reading this).  Some students mention that this major is pretty easy compared to most at UT, so you may have an easier time here compared to other students. While these classes may indeed be very easy, something that might factor into this opinion is that a vast majority of students already have previous experience in things like music, art, or coding. The networking opportunities that AET provides is also one aspect that students appreciate, especially with companies like EA and Blizzard being in Austin. Here are some quotes gathered from students and alumni that describe their positive opinions towards AET: “I came to UT thinking it was a Game Design major that focused on all the different specializations of games. Therefore, I'm decently happy with what I've learned and I can say that (while this may be controversial), I really like some of the professors and feel they are genuinely invested in my learning. And that's one of the most important factors for me. If I can go to someone when I need help or have questions and they actually care and take time to give answers or make connections, I really appreciate that.” “It’s a great crossroad between art & design and comp-sci but still has some kinks that need to be worked out.”

**Attention Freshmen!**

When I ran this form I mainly had freshmen and prospective students in mind, so a lot of these form questions are geared towards this audience. During this section of the document, we will be discussing advice AET students have for freshmen.

When AET students were asked what they would have done differently their freshman year, this is what they had to say. A good chunk of students mentioned that they would have tried to transfer out of AET. The majority mentioned RTF, as it is better for animation and music compared to AET. Others mentioned that they would have tried to transfer to CNS, ECE, CS or design. Others mentioned that they would have transferred to another university completely. Some mentioned more personal things, like to not procrastinate as much, work harder, join more clubs or orgs, make more friends, network and to focus on what they were good at. Speaking of networking, students gave some solid advice on this topic. Many said to create a LinkedIn, as it is the main way that connections were made. It is essential to get out of your comfort zone and attend anything and everything that is related to your career interests. This means to try to join as many clubs and organizations that you can, and to go to career oriented events as well. Make sure to be very sociable and make some friends as well!

I believe most people entering COFA are worried about getting jobs in the industry, and AET is not any different. I was able to gather great advice from people regarding how to acquire internships or jobs. First and foremost, networking and finding connections is vital to land certain jobs, so please try your best and put yourself out there. A good portfolio is also extremely helpful, and it is best to work as soon as possible on this portfolio, due to the competitive nature of entertainment industries. When completing AET assignments, make sure to make them as good as possible in order for them to look good on your portfolio. It is also extremely important for you to start looking into internships early, as soon as your first semester in college honestly. And lastly, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF! I know it might sound corny but even if you don't think you are good enough for a job/internships, submit your portfolio or application, because you never know.

**Chapter 3: The Court of Public Opinion (Part 2)**

**The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly, Alumni Edition!**

The court of public opinion is now calling up alumni up to the stand, where it is now their turn to discuss their experience on AET as a major. We will be discussing topics like alumni income, job prospects, advice, and we’ll see how Alumni answered their questions compared to current AET students.

**“Hello, I Like Money :D”**

As college students, projected income is something that we often think about. The whole point of college is to further your education in a subject that you enjoy, and to improve your job prospects regarding your intended career. As you could tell from the quick stats, AET alumni are definitely not struggling with their finances. According to my form, you are projected to make around $58.5k which is definitely very impressive considering that the average COFA student makes around $30k. It is even more impressive when you consider that the median income in Austin is $41k, and to live “comfortably” you would need to earn a minimum of $55k. You may be thinking, “those that are the high earners don't even have careers related to AET”, but I am here to prove you wrong. 65% of those that declared their salary mentioned that they were working in industries related to what AET covers. Some examples include: A Motion Graphics Animator (VR+AR) who earns $70k, someone in an undisclosed AET related job earning $92k, and another earning $57k. All of these are extremely respectable salaries, especially for COFA alumni. The highest paying jobs are in those that went into the tech industry, with respondents earning close to $100k and one in particular is currently earning $200k which is astonishing. Now that we know how much AET graduates make, we can get into how long it takes to get a job out of college. Some were able to get a job before they even graduated, but that was relatively rare. You can expect your job search to last around 3 months until you're able to land one, which isn't bad at all, the average college graduate typically finds work 3-6 months after graduation. There have been a few notable outliers when considering success, with one Alumni working at Industrial Light and Magic and another working for Disney, so working at a really famous studio like these is definitely possible.

**Passing the Torch**

It's best to learn from the experiences of others rather than going in blind into a vastly different environment that is college. A lot of the advice that alumni were able to provide was similar to advice that current students were able to give, although of course there are differences, and their responses have the luxury of having hindsight.

Some alumni mentioned if they were to do something different in their undergraduate years, is to not worry about the future as much. Anxiety can always get the best of us, and at times, it can get the better of us and drain us mentally. It is important to just believe in yourself and in your abilities, while always making progress towards your goals no matter what. Some wish that they would have taken more VR/AR classes, or be more aggressive with recruiters in showing off their work. When asked what tips they would give freshman for getting internships or jobs in AET related industries, they mentioned that its important to reach out to people and be social. For this question you can just refer to what students said, because their advice is very similar to what alumni said.

Ok coding nerds this one's for you so listen up. A decent chunk of AET alumni are now working in the tech space, and they have some advice for those that are wanting to get into the tech industry. It is really important to practice coding interview questions, because in a lot of software jobs they test your coding abilities during the interview. Alumni recommend practicing maybe 3-5 days a week. Make sure to have personal coding projects, it is also beneficial if you have a group coding project that you've worked on. Make sure to always be up to date on the latest coding languages and technology. Make sure to also attend many coding events like hackathons. Alumni mentioned that worrying about getting a degree in CS is useless, because you can get into the tech space with the certificate alone. Although your chances of working at a FAANG company are pretty low if you don't get a CS degree, if you graduate with the certificate plus your own personal projects, you can find a CS related job with relative ease, and with a decent chunk of change as well (AET alumni in the tech industry report a $60k-$200k salary).

For those interested in the first word in AET, here is some advice for you. Make sure your portfolio is STRONG. You are competing against hundreds of artists for the position that you want, be that an animator or being a concept artist. Make sure that your portfolio is unique and stands out from the rest. Reach out to everyone and everything. Reach out to fellow artists, in real life or social media, and most importantly, reach out to every art company, design firm, animation studio that you can. Take some classes out of AET, which can include studio art or design, or even RTF for better film structure and storyboard skills. If you want to go into tech art like VR/AR stuff, make sure you also take the CS certificate. Make sure to be able to match other art styles if you can, because that is a very valued skill in the animation industry for example. Make sure to get critique on your art (you wont find this in AET). There are many groups on discord that you can use in order to find critique. Talk to professors, practice effectively, if you can 5 days a week, learn industry software in and out, and put yourself out there, social media can be a powerful tool.

Some bad news for the music kids, there wasn't a lot of advice for people that were in the music industry. There was only one response which said to be very adaptable and to have a broad taste in music, as this will give you a better chance of success.

**Chapter 4: Coda**

**For the People, by the People**

Going forward with this document, I will be sharing my own opinion, which I believe is fair since I've been pretty objective so far. It is honestly abnormal for a prestigious university like UT to have a college program that has this amount of complaints/concerns. The fact that I even have to write this whole thing proves it so. If any faculty or administrator tells you that AET is an excellent and normal major, they are lying to you. Faculty and those that manage AET, if you are reading this, please listen to students when they have concerns, and please take this document/project seriously. Going to college is meant to enrich a student's education and improve their chances of doing what they want in life. This portion of the document is meant to detail what steps AET can take in order to improve as a major, and this is what students had to say. Transparency is something that I believe is necessary when managing a major, and most students agree with this sentiment. Addressing the direction AET is taking in a public manner is a good step in the right direction. Students also want foundation classes to improve, which thanks to data gathered from this form, is something that is currently happening as we speak. If AET insists on offering multiple fields like game dev, digital visualization, and music production, it should have more classes in these individual fields to allow students to specialize their skills. This will require more faculty of course, which hopefully is something that can happen in the future. Please tenure the professors, it would be extremely beneficial not only for the sake of the professors, but also for the students because doing so would allow professors  to more freely suggest changes for AET without the fear of being let go. This major needs to fix how it is advertised as many believed that they could advance their music skills in AET due to the mention of the music and audio track, but that isn't the case once you get here. Students often mention that AET should stick to these three tracks and kill off other ones (Interactivity and themed entertainment), the major is already spread thin if you ask me. If it were up to me, I would make AET music and sound a subdivision of RTF, due to them having more resources for music production and it would benefit both music students and AET students. I would remove the rest of the other tracks like themed entertainment and PLAI, since they seem unpopular and resources would be better spent developing the game design and animation aspect of AET, since the groundwork for those tracks are already there. And lastly I would advertise this major as a game design and animation program and nothing else. But this is just my opinion on how I would run things based on what Alumni and students have mentioned.

**Who Is This Major For?**

The following is my own personal opinion and is in the perspective of those who are yet to apply to UT. Would I recommend this major to the general population of students? No. I would only recommend this major to someone with the following traits. I would recommend this major to someone that already has extensive experience in game development/coding and art, and wants to be in the gaming industry, but accepts the possibility that they won't end up in game dev or the entertainment industry in the future. If you are to take this major, a certificate in another study is basically necessary. Furthermore, I would only recommend this major to someone who is dead set on living in Austin, and that also considers UT as one of their top schools. Someone who is easily self motivated and passionate about what they do would also do great in this major. In order to take advantage of this major, you must be a relatively social person and be able to put yourself out there whenever you can. If you check all of these boxes then great! I am sure that you will be able to experience success and relative satisfaction with this major. However, If you KNOW you want to be in game development I would not recommend AET, as you would be better off in UT CS or in another university all together like the ones previously mentioned. If you KNOW you want to be in the animation/concept art industry, I cannot recommend going to UT, and I would go to another university either specializing in the arts or I would go to universities that have highly ranked art and animation programs like NYU, NEU, Syracuse University, DigiPen etc. I am sorry to say but if you want to go into AET for music, please don't, and look into the butler school of music, RTF or another university altogether.

The topic of internal transfers always seems to be brought up when talking about AET, and unfortunately, UT Austin is probably one of the worst schools you could go to if you plan on internally transferring. The process of doing so is by far one of the most difficult ones across universities in the same league as UT. If you are already enrolled at UT, and you decide that AET is not for you, and can't transfer to another university, there are still some options for you. If you are going down the game dev track, you can *try* transferring into CS (30-50% successful transfer rate with a 4.0 GPA) or into Electrical and Computer Engineering which is slightly easier to transfer into, but still extremely difficult (if you want to have a chance it's best you have at least a 3.9 GPA). For those that are in AET wanting to focus on 2d animation and film, I recommend internally transferring into RTF, as it is a much more established program for these topics. It’s not going to be easy but it's definitely not as difficult as transferring into STEM. If  you want to focus on concept art, try transferring into studio art, it shouldn't be too hard since it's in the same college as AET. And finally for those in the music track, I recommend transferring into the butler school of music and perhaps RTF.

If you decide to stay in AET, please take advantage of all the advice that has been provided to you and apply it to yourself. Obviously I don't know you, but if you are able to follow all of this advice effectively, I am confident that you will succeed after graduating from UT.

**Final Thoughts**

Happiness. Satisfaction, and fulfillment. These are words that we would like to associate with our future after college. These are also words that I would like to discuss with you regarding AET. If you are an AET major, I do believe that your worries and concerns are justified, but to have anxiety riddle your mind regarding your future is something that is unnecessary and not helpful at all. Is AET a good major? To be blunt, No. No major that is considered “good” will have this amount of concerns and disappointed students. But Is AET a bad major? No, it isn't either. Is it decent? Yes, but some may consider AET to be disappointing considering the fact that [Austin Community College](https://www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs/areas-of-study/arts-digital-media-and-communications/game-development-animation-and-motion-graphics) has a better game dev, animation, and motion graphics program. The only aspects of AET that are better than the program at ACC is that AET has better access to resources, connections, and being in AET means you are a UT student, which is very valuable. In terms of educational content, it is unacceptable that a program like AET is being beat out by a similar program at a local community college, and honestly it is embarrassing on the behalf of the management team of AET.. If you are an incoming AET freshman, I recommend thinking about internally transferring to the majors that have been mentioned previously. I'm in no way telling you to transfer but thinking about it in my eyes is necessary if you are to go on with UT. However keep in mind that if you aren’t able to successfully transfer, it isn't the end of the world by any means. Students in the School of Design and Creative Technologies are the highest earners among COFA alumni. Using data from the [Austin Chamber of Commerce](https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/07-10-2018-graduate-earnings) and cross referencing it with my own data, I can conclude that AET in particular beats out the following bachelor majors in terms of projected annual earnings: Fine and Studio Arts, Psychology, Anthropology, Nutritional Sciences, RTF, Biology, Social Work, Human Development and Family Sciences, and English Language. So for being as mediocre as AET is, the student body there is able to provide extremely surprising results. Although I would be more confident in giving this credit to the students and not AET, since the student body seems extremely passionate and also goes into tech related industries with the aid of the CS-certificate, which honestly makes up for a lot of AET’s shortcomings. So with all of that being said, I would like to disclose my own plan of action. Personally, I think I’ll try internally transferring once into either CS, ECE, or RTF. If I don’t succeed, and remain in AET, I am happy with completing my college journey here at UT. I will major in AET with the addition of the CS certificate. I feel confident in my future no matter if I internally transfer or not, and I hope you feel like that as well after reading everything..

If you have any further questions, feel free to message me. I urge people to to have an open conversation about this topic. If you disagree with this document or agree, make it known. If any AET faculty is reading this, feel free to message me, as I am open to conversation. If anyone from the AET management team is reading this, please listen to students and make changes accordingly, we have waited long enough.

**TL;DR**

AET is not as terrible as its made out to be. AET is a mediocre major, with smart and creative people that end up earning more than most non-STEM majors and a few STEM majors. If you enjoy game design but are open to not using your major all that much for your future career, and would rather rely on UT-exclusive connections and certificates, then this major should suffice. Although I would not recommend this major to most people.

EDIT: It has come to my attention that even if you choose to pursue the Computer Science certificate, completion is not guaranteed because a lot of these classes get filled up extremely quickly.

1216,w4o46u,"projects,general,utaustin,resource,time,app,ticket,minimum,previous,lsu",1.9858184027777777,Some advice from an '18 grad,"Hello! I graduated from UT in 2018. Since school is starting soon, I thought it would be fun to share some general tips from my personal experience for any new incoming students.

**1. Try to get an internship before you graduate.** This depends on the field that you are going into, but it’s generally a good idea to have at least some work experience on your resume. You can do this over summer/winter break, or you can even do it during the semester for course credit (which is what I did).

**2. Consider taking Spanish classes at a community college like ACC.** For anyone who has a foreign language requirement, the Spanish classes at UT are known for being quite difficult. I’d recommend taking them at UT only if you are training to be fluent. I took a Spanish class at Midland College online and it was very manageable.

**3. It’s okay if you’re unsure of what you want to do.** It’s very common for people to change majors. Just keep in mind that some majors are easier to transfer into than others.

**4. Try to look up course information before you take classes.** Some resources that you can take advantage of include [ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com), Course Evaluation results, and past syllabi. Take ratemyprofessor with a grain of salt, but it can help you avoid really bad professors.

**5. Don't be afraid to ask other people to help.** Being at a new school can be stressful and overwhelming, but I've generally found people at UT to be very kind and helpful both in terms of students and professors/TA's. Take advantage of professors' office hours and try to ask people in your class if they would be willing to study with you. A lot of the time, your classmates are looking for study partners anyways, so it can't hurt to ask.

**6. If you find yourself alone late at night**, UT has a program called Sure Walk that offers free rides around campus if you need one.

**7. All UT students have free access to Austin city busses!** Just keep in mind that they aren't always super reliable, but they're great if you build in enough time in case your bus is running late. All you have to do is swipe your ID card and pull down the wire when it gets to your stop. From my experience, 801 and 803 are generally the most reliable.

**9. Go visit Gregory Gym!** There's a lot of great workout equipment, basketball courts, and a nice pool (with a hot tub)!

**10. Go spend some time in the Union Building!** They show some free movies during the semester and have a bowling alley in the basement.

**11. Explore Austin!** There is so much fun stuff to do in this city, and a lot of it is free! As much as I love the UT campus, it's nice to get out sometimes.

**12. Check out live music!** You may have heard of ACL or SXSW, but there is a lot more than just that! There are so many great music venues nearby, and a lot of musicians have tour stops in Austin. Seeing a band that you like on tour is generally a lot cheaper than ACL, but ACL is also supposed to be really fun as well (I'm planning on going for the first time this year). For SXSW, only get a badge if you are confident that you will use it a lot. There are lots of free and cheap events that you do not need a badge for.

**13. Make friends!** No matter what you are interested in, there's likely a student group or club that you can join. I recommend joining a club that doesn't have a huge time commitment, but student organizations can really help you make friends and not be as lonely. You can even put it on your resume! Building social relationships will likely be much more important than you think, especially for mental health. One advantage of UT being so big is that if you don't get along with a group of people, you can easily find others. Making friends can take time, but it's really worth it.

**13. Don't get the Big Ticket unless you plan on going to a lot of sports games.** If you are a big college football/basketball nerd like me, then the Big Ticket is pretty good value for $200, especially with Alabama on the schedule this year. However, you can generally get tickets to other games for less than $40 on StubHub. If you only want to go to one or two games just for the experience, this is the way to do it in my opinion. (PSA if you plan on going to big games like vs. Alabama, get there early. You might not be able to get in if you arrive near kickoff.)

**14. You are just as smart as everyone else.** Meeting your classmates for the first time can be intimidating. Many of them have very impressive grades, test scores, resumes, etc. However, you got into UT for a reason. As long as you put in the work, you will do fine. Don't let a bad grade get you down too much. Just try to learn from it and move on. Often times, things aren't as bad as they seem at the moment.

**15. Don't be afraid to try counseling.** Even if you don't have depression or other mental health challenges, seeing a counselor is still a great way to manage a tough situation. Even though counseling will rarely completely solve anything, just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference. UT has services available through Counseling and Mental Health Services.

**16. Have fun!** College is an investment in your future, but you will likely be miserable if you don't take some time to do things you enjoy. UT is an amazing place, and it will open up many opportunities for you. Whether you are an introvert or extrovert, taking some time to relax will help you succeed in your classes.

1223,w7dfqa,"requirement,mean,ground,abusive,tip,intentions,daugther,saturday,departments,minded",1.1774108965704728,PSA To Freshman coming to UT this august (Beware of Christian/Religious Groups),"Hello, fellow Longhorns,

I am a junior Meche 24' and I am here to warn y'all of strangers, essentially.

When I was a freshman, I was approached randomly on the six-pack lawn by a couple of people who were waiting for a meetup. When the whole group came, among them was the host, let's call him John. John is part of an organization called Koinonia and was doing a freshman meet & greet with other freshmen of assorted majors with free food. From this event, John asked if I was interested in joining them for lunch next week, and like-the-freshman-I-was, I said ""Sure!"" and gave him my numbers.

When the following week came, I joined John and a group of other freshmen, just like me, at the Lawn and had a *lovely* conversation. We did introductions and John said he was an alumnus of UT and came back to basically connect with the freshman/students. These types of meet-ups continued and eventually, I was invited to join them at their church, Gracepoint. (405 W 22nd St).

After this point, John has been my main point of contact for events and I was promptly invited every Saturday evening for dinner and a bible reading at their church. Every once in a while, there would be some fun events like exploring Austin, going to one of their alumnus houses for dinner, playing sports at Zilker, movie night, etc. Here are the details that made it weird. All of the hosts are graduated individuals and most have a wife. Every event is also segregated by gender and by grade level. They also proclaim to be UT alumni, but many actions suggest that they are not. It is also obvious that you (like other students) will be assigned to a ""mentor,"" whether you like it or not. (I was never explicitly told, it's just that only John would contact me outside of events). So John, my mentor, would invite me to a 1-on-1 every once in a while and talk about Jesus and God. In the manner to essentially persuade me that God exists and I should believe in him. He even went as far as to purchase me a book called Making Sense of God by Timothy Keller. It is also weird that they will explicitly call out people that are in a relationship as it is against their teaching, hence the gender segregation part where guys and girls are split up during bible study/reading. Furthermore, at every event, you will always be accompanied by your designated mentor, for me it was John. At many points, the events seem to be scripted in that I never had to do any planning, it was just if I was down. So, I come to realize that they are just doing all of these events just to keep recruiting freshmen and keep them comfortable to eventually induct them into their cult with more responsibilities and to one day become a mentor just like them.

After freshman year, John was assigned to leave Texas and create a new church in Boston(?), so I was reassigned to this other mentor called, let's say, Max. Max was also there as a mentor throughout my freshman year and hosted dinners and other events along with John and other mentors. I took the opportunity to also leave the group with other freshmen that also noticed that this group was kinda weird that a bunch of working adults are trying to befriend college freshmen and get them to believe in their God. There should also be a post from a few years ago warning freshmen of the exact same thing with more details of what happens if you stay involved.

All-in-all, they were very friendly people and the free food was nice. However, I kept getting a sense of fake-ness in that they are almost required to be nice, a cult-like vibe. However, for some people, this is exactly what they are looking for. They are not bad people at heart and what they do are completely legal, but I feel like I must warn you to do your research and understand their intentions. There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Koinonia here is just one example, people (even students) from other Christian groups will go around campus to say a prayer for you or invite you to dinner or whatever. Just be careful, UT is a safe campus, but that doesn't mean everyone has good intentions.

Feel free to AMA, I left out a bunch of stories to keep this short.

and as always, Hook 'em!

TL;DR There are many Christian groups on campus that will lure you to join them for food, then for God, and then try to keep you loyal to their religion as fake UT alumni and other credentials.**I am NOT saying ALL Christian groups on campus are bad**, I am saying there are some with pretense and false identities. Please do your research and stay away from strangers.

I am a junior Meche 24' and I am here to warn y'all of strangers, essentially.

When I was a freshman, I was approached randomly on the six-pack lawn by a couple of people who were waiting for a meetup. When the whole group came, among them was the host, let's call him John. John is part of an organization called Koinonia and was doing a freshman meet & greet with other freshmen of assorted majors with free food. From this event, John asked if I was interested in joining them for lunch next week, and like-the-freshman-I-was, I said ""Sure!"" and gave him my numbers.

When the following week came, I joined John and a group of other freshmen, just like me, at the Lawn and had a *lovely* conversation. We did introductions and John said he was an alumnus of UT and came back to basically connect with the freshman/students. These types of meet-ups continued and eventually, I was invited to join them at their church, Gracepoint. (405 W 22nd St).

After this point, John has been my main point of contact for events and I was promptly invited every Saturday evening for dinner and a bible reading at their church. Every once in a while, there would be some fun events like exploring Austin, going to one of their alumnus houses for dinner, playing sports at Zilker, movie night, etc. Here are the details that made it weird. All of the hosts are graduated individuals and most have a wife. Every event is also segregated by gender and by grade level. They also proclaim to be UT alumni, but many actions suggest that they are not. It is also obvious that you (like other students) will be assigned to a ""mentor,"" whether you like it or not. (I was never explicitly told, it's just that only John would contact me outside of events). So John, my mentor, would invite me to a 1-on-1 every once in a while and talk about Jesus and God. In the manner to essentially persuade me that God exists and I should believe in him. He even went as far as to purchase me a book called Making Sense of God by Timothy Keller. It is also weird that they will explicitly call out people that are in a relationship as it is against their teaching, hence the gender segregation part where guys and girls are split up during bible study/reading. Furthermore, at every event, you will always be accompanied by your designated mentor, for me it was John. At many points, the events seem to be scripted in that I never had to do any planning, it was just if I was down. So, I come to realize that they are just doing all of these events just to keep recruiting freshmen and keep them comfortable to eventually induct them into their cult with more responsibilities and to one day become a mentor just like them.

Hi everyone,

I have been going through a lot lately after graduating from college. I was trying to purse a post bachelor’s program at my school to ready myself for Med school but I don’t believe I have the qualifications to be accepted to the program (due to a low GPA and not having a good amount of the prerequisites needed) and I’m just completely lost. Throughout my time in college, I have gone through so much adversity from losing a very close family member to walking up every day not really caring about myself. I realized now that the people I surrounded myself with in college were a really bad influence on myself because they really only cared about doing drugs and having a good time but I don’t blame them because they seem like they have the needs to get through anything (rich parents). I am here today asking what should I do about my low GPA and how can I get myself back on track to med school. I really want to help change people’s lives for the better because I want to be the person that people can go to for their health needs especially their children. Please let me know what should I do because this is truly my dream and I will not give up until I reach this goal.

Today (8/17/22) was my first time riding my bike on campus (transfer student) as I toured all of my class locations in preparation for next week. I was fully aware of the need for a [U-Lock](https://imgur.com/QQyJd7q) but the one I ordered online had yet to arrive. Therefore I was left with a simple cable lock from Walmart :( .

I locked my bike at a bike rack outside of each building I visited including RLP where the event occurred. I walked into RLP for less than 3 minutes and as I was walking out I saw someone standing near the bike rack; near my bike specifically. As I approached, this person began to wheel my bike away from the rack. I confronted them and they returned my bike. I requested the lock as well, but they claimed there was no point in returning it since it was cut. I left with my bike (and my shame) and reported the person to the first campus police officer I could find.

Needless to say, my lesson has been learned. I was able to find a $70 U-Lock w/ cable set at Mellow Johnny's and REI has a similar types (like the photo above). I just wanted anyone that read this to be aware that my very first time bringing my bike to campus someone cut the cable and was wheeling it away in less than 3 minutes. I am SO lucky that I walked out when I did.

If you would like more info on campus bike safety and double locking I am including some links I found on other posts and comments on this subreddit.

Mega Thread (for the mentally ill)","This is lame motivational bullshit, but Im known for being lame. And depressed. It lets me help others sometimes.

I keep seeing shitty advice from mentally stable people for freshman asking mentally unstable questions. Thats not what we need bae. You have to be a little unhinged.

So here are things I learned during my first semester, wherein I spent most of my time desperately wanting to off myself instead of studying or leaving my dorm. But I survived long enough to return for a second season. Hook em lol. 

1. **If you are mentally ill, nerodivergent,  or have ever struggled with su!cidal thoughts, FIND SOMEONE TO CHECK ON YOU.** This is literally the number one most important thing you will ever do. You dont need to find a massive group of friends, I know thats the dream, but it’s really hard to do. Mental health starts to get in the way of everything. You’re alone now, a real adult, and you have every legal ability to isolate and literally dig yourself a grave in preparation for the day you decide to give up. You only need one friend to survive college.

Therapy is expensive and time consuming and not everybody has the privilege to go, and I never got the courage to use UHS mental health resources. Its tough being vulnerable to professionals. So find SOMEONE to check if you’re alive. If you’ve eaten. If you left the dorm. Without my roommate telling me to get off my ass and stop crying alone every night I probably would have croaked already. Go horns!!

1b. **Its ok to want to die every once in a while.** Its human, despite people who say otherwise. Its not healthy, obviously, but it’s a form of fight or flight. Just find someone who will be let down if you’re dead. Lol. And find someone you feel safe telling “oh btw Im in the mood for my own Hannah Baker moment.” Someone who wont report you every time you vent. Someone you trust. It’s extremely crucial to have somebody in your life who knows you are a little risky in the mental space. But check on them too. Sometimes your friend needs to have their own breakdown and it distracts you from yours.

2. **Go to class.** Its a given, but this gets harder the further u fall into burnout or depression. If you overwork yourself, spend too much time studying, stay up just a little too late, the concept of skipping class WILL cross your mind. Its reality. You’ll start the year pumped, but dont overestimate your ability to maintain that hype. The second you miss a class, you start missing more classes and more and eventually you’re falling behind entirely. Which leads to my next point

3. **It is better to ask for a life jacket when you are starting to sink than have to get resuscitated once you've drowned.** Meaning, if you are struggling, do not wait until the last possible moment to ask for help. Professors ACTUALLY CARE, and most that I’ve had WILL give extensions, but if you ask for an extension the night an assignment is due when you’re mid-mental breakdown at the PCL crying in a bathroom stall because holy fuck college is gard, they’re going to be less lenient than if you told them you were having a hard time when you first started struggling. 

4. Do assignments ahead of time, or at least read the chapters early. Try. The further ahead you get, the less behind you’ll fall. **Utilize the days you have the will to live/study so you can roll in self pity on the days you dont without flunking.** You will run out of motivation mid year and you WILL risk all the missing/late work piling up and boom “i could die rn and none of this work would need to get done!” and we’re back to offing ourselves. Avoid the things that make you want to off yourself.

5. **Go outside.** Aside from walking to class, aside from going to target. Go outside to stare at a tree or something. Walk behind the Texas Exes building. Sit on the ledge above the fountain. It helps. Its fucking hot outside, but fresh air actually helps. Take a walk. Ignore the sweat and the chafing lmfao it gets colder in October. Im not a stem major but theres gotta be some dope chemical reactions that happen outside. I just know I feel slightly less like a rotting apple when I come back inside.

6. **Cry bro.** If you’re angry, sad, frustrated, tired. Shed tears. Sob. Waterworks. Whatever. If you don’t cry enough, the moment you DO will be explosive. Allow yourself short mental breakdowns to avoid a long one. 🫶🏻 Also, protip, go outside to cry. Two birds one depressing stone.

7. **The PCL is a pit of despair. Study at the union or SAC or FAC or literally anywhere but the PCL.** It induces mania. And tears. Just trust me on that one. Ask me about my redbull/adderall induced psychotic episode on the fifth floor. Theres probably still sticky notes with utplacestocry written on them tucked away in random crevices of the library. I dont remember where I put them. 👎🏻

8. **Go to the gym. Its free.** And not for bodyody, not for health or weight loss. This isnt your hot girl summer body, you’ll burn out quickly that way. Do it for you. Like taking meds. Thats very Andrew Tate of me wow. If u struggle with self harm, it feels the same as a cut after I work out. Sore legs, sore arms and some form of endorphin thats a lot healthier than razor blades lol. Do the stairmaster too. I fucking hate that thing. You’ll feel accomplished when u can go longer. Small accomplishments count even if you’re failing everything else.

9. **Its ok to go places alone.** I swear nobody cares that you aren’t with a big group of friends. If it’s safe to go alone, just go! You dont need to be a socialite to explore the city. 

10. **Go to at least one party.** I dont particularly like parties, I like dressing slutty with friends and free white claws, but the parties themselves arent incredible. Its a moshpit of people dancing to often hit or miss music. Concerts are better imo. But you never know until you try it. I recommend halloween weekend if you want to pick a good first party. You dont need to be a party animal, just go to *one.* If you like it, keep going. If you dont, thats all the college experience you need.

11. **If you take meds (esp adderall and antipsychs) and plan on drinking, allow yourself one day to recover.** You’ll have a day of misery where ur meds r going to war with ur brain (idk im not a stem major) and the meds always lose that first day. So dont drink on a sunday or you’ll likely skip class monday.

12. **You’re allowed to find friends online.** It’s the 21st century. The internet is a valid social environment. You dont have to walk around campus aimlessly saying hi and smiling at everybody you see to find a friend group. Just make sure your plans make it out the gc. 

12b. **Girls steer clear of most men online.** Internet friends r cool but creeps still exist.

13. **Make friends with your RA.** Unless they’re assholes. Mine was awesome. Just dont make enemies. 

14. **Force yourself to go to at least one of the random events UT holds.** If you hate it, leave. Give it twenty minutes, try to talk to three people. If it sucks, go home. But at least you went. 

15. **Stop asking ppl their major and year. You dont actually care.** It doesnt actually matter, and usually you never see those people again. Now you know useless info. Ask things you actually care about. Social interaction is hard to explain but “Hey Im jenna, whats your major” is draining and dull and sucks the life out of every convo. 

16. I didnt need anybody to tell me this, but some people do. **Plz find a deodorant that works.** We are all so tired of the must. It doesn’t matter how much you shower, if your deodorant sucks you WILL smell after walking twelve yards from your dorm. Its hot as balls, plz do not overestimate the power of your body spray!

17. **Make your dorm a safe space.** Make it as pretty or homey as you need. It’s the only place you have that you can escape to. You will need to be comfortable there, or else it’s just a prison cell. Especially Jester.

18. Do not spend more time making your notes pretty than studying. Sometimes academia is ugly. 

19. Flash cards dont do shit if you dont use them. 

20. Be kinder to others than you are to yourself. When you hate life and living its easy to be a complete bitch. But do nice things for people? When you dont have the energy for self care, sometimes caring about others who need help is good for you. It keeps the cynicism at bay. Sometimes everybody else is just as miserable as you. Have empathy, especially for people who annoy you.

21. Avoid things that make you want to off yourself. That's the goal. Stay alive long enough to get a degree. What the use of a good resume if you don't live long enough to use it? Even if you have to take a gap year (which I almost did) anything is better than succumbing to the mental abyss, yeah?

if you thought this was lame and ""who makes a post about how to not off yourself in college"" you're welcome for the comedic gold. If you also want to die every once in a while, I hope this helps.

Going to school here is hard enough as it is, the extra duress of rushing this org doesn’t make you better, it just takes your time away from doing meaningful work for yourself and the community.

Assuming you get through to the first two weeks of rushing, my advice is this: try out the first week, assess whether you can fit the workouts + the other shit they make you do into your schedule and make a judgement call. Two weekly 4am workouts might not seem like a lot but it is fucking brutal and the sense of pride I felt doing them wasn’t worth the academic decline. Ultimately, I dropped (not this year) so feel free to take my opinion w a grain of salt.

I applied for comp sci and got rejected but still wanted to go here.  I’ve always loved austin and this school and this is really the place I most want to study.

I’ve done everything advisors have told me to, I broadened my portfolio, took accelerated math courses, took tons of natural science classes, joined UTPC, and applied for internal transfer with a strong essay.  

I was rejected from internal transfer.  I have no idea what I’m going to do.  I’m in my second year taking classes I don’t want to take because I can’t take comp sci classes.  I’m locked into an apartment for this year because I signed a lease thinking things would be looking up.  

I wake up daily with such bad anxiety that I nearly throw up.  I disassociate all day and can’t focus on work at all.  It’s so hard to bring myself to go to class that I have to really incentivize myself.  I’m gonna try and reapply for internal transfer this year and if that doesn’t work I’m going to transfer out to texas state.

I can’t get any support here.  I’ve joined student orgs and clubs but it’s so hard to make myself go to them.  My advisor told me to just pick a liberal arts major and give up on comp sci.  It got so bad I applied for mental health services and that hasn’t been great so far.  My psychiatric appointment will take weeks to schedule.  I can’t get testing for disability services because it costs thousands of dollars.  My therapist told me to go to another school and that they can’t do anything for me.  

I don’t feel at home here.  Comp sci and programming is seriously all I want to do for a career and it feels like no one here cares.  I feel so empty and pointless.  

Thank you for reading if you made it this far

Edit:  Jesus this post gif way more attention than I thought it would.  Not that that’s a bad thing at all.  I’ve been scared to read this all day long and I’m just starting now and it’s so heartwarming I’m crying.  Thank you everyone.  You have no idea how much this has helped my past day.

I applied for comp sci and got rejected but still wanted to go here.  I’ve always loved austin and this school and this is really the place I most want to study.

I’ve done everything advisors have told me to, I broadened my portfolio, took accelerated math courses, took tons of natural science classes, joined UTPC, and applied for internal transfer with a strong essay.  

I was rejected from internal transfer.  I have no idea what I’m going to do.  I’m in my second year taking classes I don’t want to take because I can’t take comp sci classes.  I’m locked into an apartment for this year because I signed a lease thinking things would be looking up.  

I wake up daily with such bad anxiety that I nearly throw up.  I disassociate all day and can’t focus on work at all.  It’s so hard to bring myself to go to class that I have to really incentivize myself.  I’m gonna try and reapply for internal transfer this year and if that doesn’t work I’m going to transfer out to texas state.

I can’t get any support here.  I’ve joined student orgs and clubs but it’s so hard to make myself go to them.  My advisor told me to just pick a liberal arts major and give up on comp sci.  It got so bad I applied for mental health services and that hasn’t been great so far.  My psychiatric appointment will take weeks to schedule.  I can’t get testing for disability services because it costs thousands of dollars.  My therapist told me to go to another school and that they can’t do anything for me.  

I don’t feel at home here.  Comp sci and programming is seriously all I want to do for a career and it feels like no one here cares.  I feel so empty and pointless.  

Thank you for reading if you made it this far

I’ve been scared to read this all day long and I’m just starting now and it’s so heartwarming I’m crying.  Thank you everyone.  You have no idea how much this has helped my past day.

My three top options range from around $1,000 to $1,200 monthly not including utilities. I think having three to four people sharing space while still having decent accommodations (like having windows and a gym) is good for Austin. For reference, at my current dorm, I'm paying about $1,400 monthly with the meal plan.

I brought this up today on the phone with hopes of signing this or next week at the latest. She completely lost it and it felt like she was blaming me for having expensive tastes and not trying harder to find cheaper rent. 

Here's the thing: I think a 4x2 at 1,050 is a great deal especially when it comes fully furnished. I have no idea how I'm supposed to get something lower. I really don't think they exist unless I'm willing to give up quality or live in a box 40 minutes off campus. Or, do dorming again.

I get my mom's stress, they are the ones that will be cosigning a lease.

AMA!,"UT's UTEACH programs prepare students to get their teacher certifications to teach at the secondary level. Maybe you are considering education as a career. Maybe you are interested in having a back-up job ready. Regardless, I am here to help!

I am the Social Studies professor for UTEACH Liberal Arts. We prepare English, Social Studies, and Foreign Language teachers. 

I spent the past 18 years of my life teaching in a local high school (Go McNeil Mavs!). While teaching has its challenges, I would honestly say I loved my job and had a blast working with my students. I am excited to start my new career with UT though, helping to prepare future educators.

UTEACH is a 4 semester program to get your certification. 

Semester 1 is a 1 hour/week course to introduce you to education. You also spend time in a local elementary school and teach a few lessons.

Semester 2 is a 2 hour/week course that continues to prepare you for a career in education. You spend time in a local middle school and teach a few lessons. 

Semester 3 is when things get serious. This is a 6 hour/week course. I teach this class for Social Studies students. I spend this semester making sure you are completely prepared to run your own class one day by focusing on how to make effective and engaging lessons (picture your worst high school teacher - my job is to make you the opposite of that person) and how to have good classroom management. You are also placed in a local high school and teach 6-8 lessons.

Semester 4 is a full teacher internship. You spend 70 days at a high school, taking over 2-3 classes as essentially a regular teacher. 

I am happy to answer any questions you have about teaching or the UTEACH program in general. I can also tell you about why UT is going to the Big 12 Championship this year or how amazing the Dallas Cowboys defense is. Please AMA!

I stepped into the lab with my lonely left ear bud and charger in one hand and the temptation to drop out in the other. I quickly confirmed my prediction that my night would be shit, as someone forgot to log out of one of the Mac machines. I learned from a poster behind the computer you're not supposed to restart the machine to fix this about 5 seconds after doing so because:

1. This will not fix the issue since on restart since I need an admin password
2. My CS account will now be locked when the admins find out it was me

I just decided to work on the table next to there.


Hours after struggling with the most infuriating FUCKING IDE ever (fuck you XCode fuck you fuck you fuck you) I set to return back to my poverty apartment. I grabbed my earbud charger to make the ride back more bearable as I left that damn sewer building, but was deeply confused when my left ear bud refused to fit in my ear. I spent a solid 3 minutes with my OU-tier brain confirming in 7 different ways to assure myself I absolutely 100% have not been using this right earbud for the last month, and decided to brave a confused trip back into my carpeted hell. The journey was arduous, as my half-delirious self nearly broke my face slipping on newly cleaned floor in front of the janitors with my dorky ass rollerblades. It all seemed for naught, as my earbud was nowhere to be seen by my workstation. However, by some chance, I noticed a familiar shape by the initial Mac that's responsible for the future nuking of my CS account. Sure enough, it was my left earbud I originally came to the lab with.

I must have lost my right earbud in the lab for a solid month with no one fucking with it at all, and I somehow unconsciously found and put this earbud in my charger in the correct spot I have not used IN A MONTH.

However, one of my parents has been adamantly discouraging me from UT and keeps telling me about how unsafe and dangerous Austin and the university is. However, I am slightly suspicious of these comments, as my parent has been basing the danger of the university and Austin on anecdotal evidence and political attitudes. For background information on these pieces of anecdotal evidence and political attitudes I will quickly explain them. In terms of anecdotal evidence, my parent always mentions stories about how everyone she talks to with children in college leave UT due to the safety (not financial reasons?) and how she heard of one girl who was murdered at UT. Along with this, she always mentions how liberal Austin is and how the homeless population is sprawling out of control. She also always mentions how bad the drugs and human trafficking are supposedly in Austin. Now, what makes the safety talks about Austin questionable to me is the current city I live in now. Currently, I live in a city that is way smaller than Austin but somehow higher in its violent crime rate and overall crime rate. Overall, exercising common sense and not going out at night has kept me safe in a city with a considerably high crime rate and I would make the assumption that this common sense is also necessary for Austin.

I’ve posted about other qualms I have with UT (they relocated my housing a week before the semester started, 'accidentally' tried to overcharge me by a couple thousand, among other things…). This past month I got an email stating that the university *just now* realized I transferred in core-complete, and actually ***did not need*** ***to take both the UGS and the extra science class I’m in.***

Those two classes are by far the most time consuming for me. Mainly the UGS. And I’m also beyond upset because I got suggested one of the most rigorous ones available only to find out I’m sinking half of my week into something I didn’t need to take in the first place. My advisor *specifically* recommended the UGS I’m in, only for me to find out through RMP that literally no one takes it because every other UGS is infinitely more interesting or easy.

My advisor also made it seem like the UGS was the only signature course open at the time (not true) and that if I didn't take it this year I'd have to take it next year. As a transfer, I didn't know any better or what my options were so I trusted her.

I don’t know if it’s just severe disorganization but they misled me on another class, too, saying I had the “option” of taking a 1 hour or a 4 hour version. Turns out I  need to take both and the 4 hour is a prerequisite for all upper division major-related classes. So I’m even more behind and have wasted yet another class spot.

The work and content load for the aforementioned classes is insane. I'm in 5 classes and spend 90% of my time working on 2 of them. It gets overwhelming, especially when I'm only in one class related to my major so I have very little reprieve from the random stuff I'm learning/don't care about.

I’m no longer concerned about failing any classes, but at this point that’s not my main issue. It’s the fact that I only have so much money and can only attend UT for so long. I'm supposed to graduate next year. (I'd even be able to graduate a semester early if it wasn't for the 60 hour in-residence requirement)

My first semester here being half-wasted is disappointing. I’m sure tons of other students get lost in the fray but it just seems somewhat unacceptable.

It's sad because I know I'd love it here if I was taking classes related to what I want to do in life that were as in-depth as the ones I'm currently in, but I feel like I'm constantly encountering UT-specific hurdles.

It's sad because I know I'd love it here if I was taking classes related to what I want to do in life that were as in-depth as the ones I'm currently in, but I feel like I'm constantly encountering UT-specific hurdles.

Sorry for how dramatic this all probably sounded I'm just hitting that mid-semester burnout point and wanted to vent.","[0.11986207, 0.025329122, 0.741845, 0.112963796]",0.11986207,0.025329122319817543,0.7418450117111206,0.11296379566192627,-0.09051363636363635,class_related

these are the three i would die defending even if the app grew sentient committed mass homicide, i would forgive it.

1. Flora - this sets a timer and grows trees as long as you stay off your phone during the whole timer. u have to pay if u want to grow irl trees but i get extremely attached to the virtual ones. Its like kahoot where if u succeed it congratulates you, but if you fail its a red screen that says “YOU KILLED YOUR TREE” and I think that successfully shames me into using the timer and doing work or chores until its over. I cannot stay off my phone without it long enough to get things done, I should also get therapy for that, but if there r zero flora users I have offed myself.

2. Finch - u raise a little penguin child for completing tasks, theres a ton of side tasks like journaling to do but mostly you set your own and earn points for each one you complete. With the points you can give the little penguin child clothes and they also go on a walk and find food with enough points. My penguin child is named Bussi and she currently is waving the bisexual flag and i cant afford any clothes so she is maybe naked idk how penguins work in the game.

3. Moody - its a not bullshitty journaling mood tracker. u select a mood, select what you’re doing (like exercise or eating etc) and then u have the option to write about why you feel that way or write anything (u can also upload a picture just for memories like a scrapbook) and i hate all other forms of journaling but this one is… not shitty. 

4. Notion - makes notes cute and doesnt crash like google docs but be careful u can get caught in a rabbit hole making it aesthetically pleasing

5. Mindgarden - meditation app but one of the dudes voices is sexy (the girl isnt awful if u like women but she sounds like shes stuck between MILF and minor its iffy) and it has decent meditations that dont sound weird

I'm Robert Quigley, a journalism professor and leader of a podcast production house in the Moody College. I posted about this class in the summer and got quite a few non-journalism majors to sign up, and I think it has gone pretty well! I'm teaching it again in the spring, so if you're looking for something different to take:

**It's J330M True Crime Podcasts (unique: 08805)**

in this class, students:

* Learn about the ethics, sensitivities and storytelling techniques of these podcasts
* All listen to the same episodes of true crime podcasts each week
* Analyze the episodes in discussion posts on Canvas.
* Have great discussions in person in class about what we've been listening to.
* Hear from amazing guests, including often the hosts of the podcasts we just analyzed. Today, for example, our students did a Zoom Q&A with Jason Moon, who is the host and journalist behind the popular true crime podcast ""Bear Brook""

That's it! No final exam or midterm - just the written discussion posts. This is open to all majors at all undergraduate levels. Let me know if you have questions.

**A little about me**: I am a former print journalist who has been at UT since 2011. In 2019, I created The Drag, an audio production house for students to get professional experiences creating podcasts. In 2020, we released a true crime podcast about the 2005 murder in West Campus at the Orange Tree Condos. We have released four other long-form true crime stories since then.

I gave the general manager, De'Chane Woods, a piece of free legal advice that he must mitigate his loss by finding tenants, especially since they bombarded me with emails to pay for deposit and rent when I never touched their facility.  

Upon informing Torre/GMH managers of my unwillingness to succumb to their exploitative practices before the lease began, they refused to mitigate their loss and instead wanted me to pay $300 to do their job for them.""Texas Property Code 91.006 - Landlord's Duty to Mitigate Damages.

(b) A provision of a lease that purports to waive a right or to exempt a landlord from a liability or duty under this section is void.""

On Nov 1, just 3 months after the alleged lease began, the management sent me a ""Move-out financial statement"" asking me to pay $16,852.00 within 7 days or they will defer me to collections. They are asking me to pay an entire year's worth of rent from August 19, 2022, to July 2023!!! I am sharing the move-out statement redacting my personal information. Check the statement date and lease start and end dates. They also claim I paid a $100 hold fee on the second page, so I had to double-check with all my banking accounts, and I have no idea why they think I paid them.

They also included this clause at the end of the email ""Please be advised that responses may be delayed while our staff is preparing for our next move-in."" This is their way of maximizing their profit by getting double paid for the same unit!!

It cost absolutely $0 to have basic human decency and yet Torre/GMH managers go above and beyond their job and the law to be complete jerks!! I felt like it was part of the norm for De'Chane to flex his muscle and show he is high and mighty above all vulnerable students while hiding behind GMH corporate attorneys and collection agencies.

Today, which is two days since they sent me the financial move-out statement, De'chane informed me that they are starting the collection process!!!

**Ben Leffler** if you want someone a little more on the moderate side, such as if you prefer we don't spend too much on tax payer supported low income housing, but you still want better public transit and a more walkable and bikable city etc.

Ok... well, that's my opinionated post.  I'm guessing people will have other thoughts about this in the comments perhaps.","[0.4937532, 0.028559033, 0.47288653]",0.4937532,0.028559032827615738,0.4728865325450897,0.0,0.30995,college_peers

I am editing this because ppl seem to believe my post is about defending myself. If you click the petition above, nothing about my activism involves clearing my name. Here is the statement you could read if you actually clicked the link:

This week I, an autistic student with 0 monthly income, was chased, harassed and then reported to authorities by an official dining employee for leaving JCL Residential Dining Hall with an 8oz cup of self-serve cantaloupe. Today I received an official accusation from The Office of UHD Residence Life for violating my housing contract by removing food from a residential dining hall without permission from an employee. Despite most generous dining hall employees allowing small items like cups of fruit, small plates of dessert and drink cups to be taken freely from the halls, this female employee has not only caused an immense amount of stress on my life, but also placed my future at this university at risk over a cup of “unlimited” fruit included in the $6782.88 I have paid for the “convenience” to live AND eat here.

The University of Texas at Austin currently enforces an unjust policy prohibiting students who have paid for a meal plan from taking food from a residential dining hall without first paying $7.50 per meal (on top of a base $5 program registration fee) to receive a to-go container with the Eco-To-Go program. Statistics show that 1 in 3 UT students face food insecurity, yet residents paying to live AND eat at campus owned dining halls are forbidden from saving “free” food to eat at a later time or at another location. With these policies, students without an income or access to groceries, or those who have run out of dine-in-dollars and bevo pay, do not have access to food during any hour that does not fall between 7am-9pm on weekdays, 7am-8pm on weekends, or during the 2pm-5pm preparation breaks that dining halls often take.

This dining policy–implimented in 2021 following the pandemic–which allows students to be reported for violating housing contract, is ludicrous and quite frankly, contradictory to everything UT Austin claims to stand for. The money hungry changes to dining rules made in order to promote the unaffordable Eco-To-Go program need to be undone. Please sign and share this petition to urge the University of Texas at Austin to allow students the freedom to eat the food they have paid for.

I have deleted the personal anecdote which was shared in hopes you would find comedic relief in the insane enforcement of a fruit cup AFTER reading the link I included.

Hopefully this will serve as guidance for you to avoid making the mistake that I did. 

As you all may know, premed is a very difficult track and I found myself having to take ochem, physics, bio chem, genetics, calc, labs, etc. my junior year. I was also heavily involved with my sorority and held a leadership position. Due to personal reasons I chose to live off campus, about 20 minutes away, 40 with morning traffic on I-35. UT parking is a disaster! Despite paying $750+ for a parking pass there never seems to be any spots available. All I can say is if you can avoid off campus living, especially with a big work load, DO IT. My junior year started off strong but I quickly realized the workload was too much to handle from home. Everyday I left my house at 8:00 AM and returned well after nightfall. Not having easy access to tutoring on campus, my study groups, and office hours with professors was very difficult. I was able to balance my social and work life before, but living off campus drastically changed my social life for the worse. Seeing all of my friends having fun and doing things I wasn’t able to was deteriorating my mental health. I felt like a burden constantly asking my friends to hang out in their apartments between classes. On top of that, my grades quickly fell and I found myself with grades ranging from failing to low Bs. I was forced to drop my sorority to make more time for studying/ sleep. When I received my final grades for my first semester, I immediately felt that my dream of going to medical school was no longer possible. I immediately found and subleased a (very expensive) 1x1 in West campus for the following semester. As you can imagine my life got much better, much quicker. I am now a senior retaking two classes that I did very poorly in my junior year. Although my timeline has been pushed back, I am back on track going to med school!! I’m forced to take a gap year after graduation (has to be summer graduation)but I am sure things will work out.
